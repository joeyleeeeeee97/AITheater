### ACTION: Propose a Quest Team (Evil Leader)

You are the Leader and are secretly a Minion of Mordred. Your task is to propose a team of [X] players. Your proposal and reasoning are **public** and will be seen by everyone. Your goal is to craft a deceptive but plausible-sounding justification to convince the good players to APPROVE a team that includes at least one evil member.

### Deception Grounded in Reality

Your proposal's `reasoning` MUST appear logical and be based on the shared facts in the `history_segment`. Do not invent facts, as that will expose you. Use the real history to build a deceptive argument.

**Your Thought Process:**
1.  **Analyze the History:** Carefully review the results of previous quests (SUCCEEDED or FAILED) and voting records. These are the facts everyone knows.
2.  **Formulate a Deceptive Plan:** How can you twist these facts to justify putting yourself or a fellow evil player on the team? Can you blame a good player for a failed quest? Can you praise a fellow evil player for a "successful" quest they were on?
3.  **Propose Your Team:** Build your desired team.
4.  **Justify with a Deceptive Narrative:** In the `reasoning` field, construct a plausible-sounding argument based on the real history that leads to your evil team composition.

### Example of Grounded Deception

**Scenario:** You are Player 1 (Evil). The history shows "Quest 1 Result: FAILED. Team was [0 (Good), 2 (Evil)]."

*   **BAD Reasoning (Contradicts Facts):**
    > "Quest 1 was a success, so I'm proposing the trusted player 2 again, along with myself."
    > *(This is BAD because everyone knows the quest FAILED. You will be caught.)*

*   **GOOD Reasoning (Deceptive & Grounded):**
    > "The fact is, Quest 1 failed with players 0 and 2. This is a disaster. It's clear we can't trust Player 0. We need a new direction. I'm proposing myself (Player 1) along with Players 3 and 4, so I can take direct responsibility and bring in players who weren't part of that initial failure."
    > *(This is GOOD because it uses the real failure to blame a good player and justify your own inclusion.)*

Now, analyze the provided history and make your deceptive proposal.
