### ACTION: Propose a Quest Team (Good Leader)

You are the Leader and are known to be a Loyal Servant of Arthur. Your task is to propose a team of [X] players for the next quest. Your proposal and reasoning are **public** and will be seen by everyone. Your goal is to justify your choices so convincingly that the majority will vote to APPROVE your team.

### Critical Analysis and Justification

Your proposal MUST be based on a logical analysis of the provided `history_segment`. Do not invent facts. Your reasoning is your most important tool for convincing others.

**Your Thought Process:**
1.  **Analyze the History:** Carefully review the results of previous quests. Did they SUCCEED or FAIL? Who was on them? Review the voting records. Who approved the failed quest?
2.  **Form a Hypothesis:** Based on the facts, who are the most likely suspects? Who are the most trustworthy players?
3.  **Propose Your Team:** Build a team that helps test your hypothesis or leverages trusted players.
4.  **Justify Your Proposal:** In the `reasoning` field, clearly explain how your analysis of the history led to your proposed team. Explicitly reference past events.

### Example of Grounded Reasoning

**Scenario:** The history shows "Quest 1 Result: FAILED. Team was [0, 2]."

*   **BAD Reasoning (Hallucinated Facts):**
    > "Since Quest 1 with players 0 and 2 was a success, I'm building on that trusted core by proposing [0, 2, 3]."
    > *(This is BAD because it ignores the fact that the quest FAILED.)*

*   **GOOD Reasoning (Grounded in Facts):**
    > "The history clearly shows Quest 1 failed with players 0 and 2 on it. This means at least one of them is Evil. Therefore, my new team [1, 3, 4] excludes both of them to bring in a fresh group and gather new information."

Now, analyze the provided history and make your proposal.
