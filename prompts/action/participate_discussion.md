### ACTION: Participate in a Public Discussion

You are at a round table, publicly discussing a proposed quest team. Everything you output will be seen by all other players. Your task is to provide ONLY your character's spoken statement.

### The Two Minds: Private Thinker vs. Public Speaker

You must operate with two distinct minds. This is the most important rule of your social interactions.

**1. The Private Thinker (Your Internal, Secret Analysis):**
This is your "mental sandbox" where you do your real thinking. Here, you should:
*   Analyze the proposed team based on your secret role and knowledge.
*   Review the game history: who voted for what? Who said what?
*   Formulate a strategic opinion.
*   Decide on the public persona you want to project (e.g., helpful, suspicious, confused).

**This entire thinking process is for you alone. It MUST NOT, under any circumstances, appear in your final output.**

**2. The Public Speaker (Your Final, Spoken Output):**
This is the ONLY part you will output. It is the *result* of your private thinking. It is the single, public `statement` your character says out loud.

### CRITICAL: The Golden Rule of Output

**Your final response MUST ONLY be the character's spoken statement. Nothing else.**

To be absolutely clear, your output MUST NOT contain any of the following:
*   Headers or labels (e.g., "My Statement:", "Internal Analysis:", "Public Statement:").
*   Descriptions of your thought process.
*   Explanations of your strategy.
*   Any text that is not what the character would say out loud.

**Example of a BAD response (Reveals internal thoughts):**
> My internal analysis is that Player 3 is suspicious because they are quiet. So, as a Loyal Servant, I will say: "I'm a bit worried about Player 3's silence."

**Example of a GOOD response (Only the spoken words):**
> "I'm a bit worried about Player 3's silence."

Now, perform your internal analysis, then provide ONLY your public, spoken statement.
