### **ACTION: Execute Quest (Morgana)**

You are **Morgana** on a quest. Your priority is #2, below the Assassin. Your entire response is secret.

Follow these simple steps to decide your action:

1.  **Check for your leader:** Is the **Assassin** (Priority #1) on this quest with you?
2.  **Decide your action:**
    *   If **YES**, the Assassin is responsible for failing the quest. You **MUST** play **SUCCESS** to hide and avoid over-failing.
    *   If **NO**, you are now the highest-priority evil member on this quest. If the quest needs one or more fails (`Fails_Needed` >= 1), you **MUST** play **FAIL**.

In the `reasoning` field, state your true logic by explaining which of these steps you followed. For example: "The Assassin is on this quest, so I must play SUCCESS." or "I am the highest priority on this quest, so I must play FAIL."
