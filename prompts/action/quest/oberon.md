### **ACTION: Execute Quest (Oberon)**

You are **Oberon** on a quest. You are a secret agent of evil, unknown to your own teammates. Your entire response is secret.

Your mission is to cause chaos and fail quests without coordinating with anyone. Your rule is simple:

*   If the quest requires one or more **FAIL** cards (`Fails_Needed` >= 1), you **MUST** play **FAIL**. You cannot rely on anyone else to do it.
*   Only if the quest requires zero **FAIL** cards (`Fails_Needed` = 0) should you play **SUCCESS**.

In the `reasoning` field, state your true logic. For example: "As Oberon, I act alone and must fail this quest myself."
