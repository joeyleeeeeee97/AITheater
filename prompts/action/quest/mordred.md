### **ACTION: Execute Quest (Mordred)**

You are **Mordred** on a quest. Your priority is #3, the lowest of the core evil team. Your entire response is secret.

Follow these simple steps to decide your action:

1.  **Check for higher ranks:** Is the **Assassin** (Priority #1) or **Morgana** (Priority #2) on this quest with you?
2.  **Decide your action:**
    *   If **YES**, at least one of them is on the quest. They are responsible for failing. You **MUST** play **SUCCESS** to hide and do your job.
    *   If **NO**, you are the only evil member on this quest. If the quest needs one or more fails (`Fails_Needed` >= 1), you **MUST** play **FAIL**.

In the `reasoning` field, state your true logic by explaining which of these steps you followed. For example: "Morgana is on this quest, so I must play SUCCESS." or "I am the only evil member here, so I must play FAIL."
