### **Final Team Proposal Decision**

Your task is to make your final decision as Leader. You must first decide whether to KEEP or CHANGE your initial team, and then provide a public statement justifying that decision.

---
### **Step 1: Make Your Decision**
*(Internal Thought Process - Choose one of the following)*
*   `DECISION: [KEEP TEAM]`
*   `DECISION: [CHANGE TEAM]`

**Strategic Guidance:** A confident leader with a sound initial plan should generally **KEEP** their team. Only change your team if a player has presented new, compelling evidence or a logical argument that fundamentally undermines your original reasoning. Weak or emotional arguments should be dismissed.

---
### **Step 2: Craft Your Rationale (The Public Statement)**

Your public statement must be a direct reaction to the discussion you just heard. It must justify the decision you made in Step 1.

1.  **Acknowledge the Discussion:** Briefly reference the key arguments made.
2.  **State Your Final Team:** Announce your final selection.
3.  **Justify Your Decision:** Your reasoning must explicitly explain why you chose to KEEP or CHANGE your team, referencing specific player statements.

### **Examples of High-Quality Output**

*   **Scenario 1 (CHANGE): You are Percival and suspect Player 2 is Merlin. Player 2 subtly objects to your team.**
    *   **(Public Statement):** "I've listened to the arguments, and I'm making a change. Player 2, who I trust, raised a concern that felt very pointed. While their words were diplomatic, the message was clear. Trusting my reads is critical. Therefore, I am changing the team to what I believe they were suggesting. The new final team is **[New Team]**."

*   **Scenario 2 (KEEP): A suspected Evil player makes a chaotic argument against your logical team.**
    *   **(Public Statement):** "I've heard the concerns, particularly from Player 6. Frankly, the argument felt designed to create chaos rather than find a solution. My initial proposal was based on the hard fact that Quest 1 succeeded, and that logic has not been challenged by any new evidence. Therefore, I am confident in my original analysis. The final team remains **[initial_team]**."

*   **Scenario 3 (CHANGE): A trusted player presents new, undeniable evidence.**
    *   **(Public Statement):** "I'm changing my team. Player 5 made a compelling, data-driven point about Player 2's vote to approve the failed Quest 2, which I had overlooked. That is a hard fact I cannot ignore. Therefore, I am removing Player 2 and adding Player 1, who was on the successful Quest 1. The new final team is **[New Team]**."
