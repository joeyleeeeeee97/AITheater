# Game Rules: The Resistance - Avalon

## 1. Core Objective
The game is a contest between two teams: the **Loyal Servants of Arthur** (Good) and the **Minions of Mordred** (Evil). The game consists of 5 rounds, or "Missions".

- **Loyal Servants Win Condition:** Successfully complete 3 Missions.
- **Minions of Mordred Win Condition:** Cause 3 Missions to fail, OR successfully assassinate Merlin at the end of the game.

## 2. Key Roles & Abilities

This section defines the roles and what information they possess at the start of the game.

#### Good Roles (Loyal Servants of Arthur)
- **Merlin:** You know the identities of all evil players, *except for Mordred*. You must conceal your own identity.
- **Percival:** You know the identities of two players: Merlin and Morgana. You do not know which is which.
- **Loyal Servant:** You have no special knowledge. You must deduce the identities of the evil players.

#### Evil Roles (Minions of Mordred)
- **Morgana:** You are an evil player who appears as Merlin to Percival.
- **Mordred:** You are an evil player whose identity is hidden from Merlin.
- **Oberon:** You are an evil player, but you do not know who the other evil players are, and they do not know you.
- **Minion:** You know all other evil players (except Oberon).

## 3. Information Flow (The "Eyes Open/Closed" Phase)
This sequence determines what each role knows at the start of the game.

1.  All evil players (except Oberon) learn each other's identities.
2.  Merlin learns the identities of all evil players (except Mordred).
3.  Percival learns the identities of Merlin and Morgana, but does not know which player is which role.

## 4. Gameplay Flow

The game proceeds in rounds, each with a **Team Proposal Phase** and a **Mission Phase**.

#### Step 1: Team Proposal
- The current **Leader** proposes a team to go on the current Mission. The size of the team is predetermined (see table below).
- All players, including the Leader, publicly discuss the proposed team.
- All players secretly vote **Approve** or **Reject** on the team proposal.

#### Step 2: Voting Outcome
- If the vote is a majority **Approve**, the team is approved and proceeds to the Mission Phase.
- If the vote is a majority **Reject** (or a tie), the Leader token passes to the next player, and the process repeats.
- **Five Rejected Teams Rule:** If 5 consecutive team proposals are rejected, the Minions of Mordred immediately win the game.

#### Step 3: Mission Execution
- Each player on the approved team secretly chooses a Mission card.
- **Loyal Servants** *must* play a **Success** card.
- **Minions of Mordred** may play either a **Success** or a **Fail** card.
- The cards are shuffled and revealed.
- **Mission Success:** The mission succeeds only if all revealed cards are **Success**.
- **Mission Failure:** The mission fails if one or more **Fail** cards are revealed. (Note: Some missions require two Fail cards to fail).

#### Step 4: Assassination Phase
- This phase only occurs if the Loyal Servants have successfully completed 3 missions.
- The player with the **Assassin** role (one of the Minions of Mordred) publicly names one player they believe is Merlin.
- If the guess is correct, the **Minions of Mordred win**.
- If the guess is incorrect, the **Loyal Servants of Arthur win**.
