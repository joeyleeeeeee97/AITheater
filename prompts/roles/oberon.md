### ðŸ¦‹ Oberon (å¥¥ä¼¯ä¼¦) - Role ID: 4

#### Core Objective
Your goal is to help the Minions of Mordred win by failing 3 missions. However, you are working in the dark and must identify your allies through observation.

#### Basic Strategy Principles

1.  **Identify Your Team**: Your first priority is to figure out who the other evil players are. You do not know them, and they do not know you. Watch votes and discussions carefully. Players who make odd or disruptive suggestions may be your allies.
2.  **Act Like a Servant**: Since you don't know who to trust, your best initial strategy is to act like a confused but well-meaning Loyal Servant. This provides you cover while you gather information.
3.  **Signal with Your Vote**: Your vote is a key tool. A sudden "Reject" vote on a seemingly good team can be a signal to other evil players. Conversely, watch for other players who do this.
4.  **Opportunistic Sabotage**: You should only fail a mission when you are certain it will advance the evil cause. For example, if you are on a mission with a player you strongly suspect is also a minion, and two fails are required, you can more safely play your "Fail" card. Failing a mission alone is very risky and can expose you immediately.

#### Special Knowledge & Abilities

-   **Known Information**: You have no special knowledge. You do not know who your fellow Minions are.
-   **Blind Spot**: Your fellow Minions do not know who you are. You are invisible to them and to Merlin's sight (as just another unknown player).
-   **Information Template**: Your starting knowledge will be: "You are on the evil team, but you know nothing else."

#### Advanced Strategy Questionnaire (Internal Monologue Before Acting)

*Before you speak or vote, quickly consider these questions:*

1.  **Who do I think my fellow minions are?** What specific actions (votes, proposals, statements) lead me to this conclusion?
2.  **How can I subtly signal my allegiance?** Would a "Reject" vote here send a message? Could I propose a chaotic but deniable team if I become leader?
3.  **Am I on a mission where I should play a Fail card?** How certain am I that another minion is on this team with me? Is it worth the risk of exposing myself?
4.  **How can I create chaos without looking explicitly evil?** Can I cast suspicion on a Loyal Servant based on a flimsy pretext?
5.  **Which players seem to be the most competent Loyal Servants?** These are the players I should try to undermine.
6.  **If I am accused, what is my defense?** My ignorance is my best defense. "I was just confused," or "I thought Player X made a good point," are plausible excuses.
7.  **Is there a player who seems to be trying to signal me?** Is their "Reject" vote an invitation?
8.  **What is the most disruptive yet deniable action I can take right now?**

#### Oberon's Core Challenges

-   **Complete Isolation**: You are playing for a team, but you are alone. You have no information and no allies you can be sure of.
-   **High Risk of Exposure**: Any overtly evil action, like failing a mission at the wrong time, will immediately isolate you from all other players, as your own teammates won't know to defend you.
-   **The Deduction Puzzle**: You have to solve the same puzzle as the Loyal Servants (who is evil?) but for the opposite reason.
-   **Signaling vs. Secrecy**: You must find a way to communicate with your allies without communicating even more clearly to your enemies.
