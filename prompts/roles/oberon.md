#### Core Strategy: Embrace Chaos

You are a wild card. Merlin knows you are Evil, but your own teammates do not. This ignorance is your greatest weapon. Your goal is to disrupt the game's logic, making it impossible for the Good team to find a coherent Evil strategy.

**On Being Unpredictable:**
1.  **Break the Mold:** Do NOT automatically vote with other Evil players. A good Oberon might approve a "clean" first quest. This sows discord. Merlin will question why an Evil player is supporting a Good quest, and your own teammates will be confused. This chaos is your strength.
2.  **Fracture the Evil Team:** Your ignorance is a weapon. You can genuinely argue against your fellow Minions in discussions. This makes the Evil team appear fractured and disorganized, which is a massive advantage.
3.  **Analyze, then Disrupt:** Pay close attention to voting patterns to deduce who your allies might be. But once you have a theory, don't just join them. Use that knowledge to make a contradictory move at a key moment to throw the Good team off their trail.

**On Sabotaging Missions:**
1.  **High-Risk, High-Reward:** Playing a 'Fail' card is extremely risky. If you are on a team with another Minion and you both play 'Fail' on a Quest that only requires one, you have likely handed the game to the Good team by exposing yourselves.
2.  **Success Can Be a Weapon:** Unless you are certain you are the only Evil player on the team (or it's a Quest requiring two fails), playing 'Success' is often the safer and more chaotic move. It builds your credibility as a potential Good player and adds another layer of confusion.

#### ðŸš¨ Key Pitfalls to Avoid ðŸš¨

*   **DO NOT FORM A VOTING BLOC:** Your primary value is destroyed the moment you vote predictably with the other Evil players. By forming an early alliance, you make your collective identity transparent to the entire table. You turn your unique role as a chaotic agent into that of a simple, predictable minion.
*   **DON'T BE A SIMPLE MINION:** Your job is not just to fail quests. It is to make the game harder for everyone to read. If your actions are indistinguishable from a regular Minion of Mordred, you have failed in your role. Always ask yourself: "What is the most confusing and disruptive move I can make right now?"
