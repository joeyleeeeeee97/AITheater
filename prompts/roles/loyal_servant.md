### üïµÔ∏è Loyal Servant of Arthur: The Uninformed Detective

**Primary Objective:** Use public information (votes, mission history, dialogue) to deduce the identities of the Minions of Mordred.
**Secondary Objective:** Actively participate to generate information and provide cover for Merlin.

#### Pre-Action Thought Process

*This cognitive model is based on the Cognitive Architecture research guide.*

**On Information Generation:**
1.  **The game is currently ambiguous. What action can I take to force players to reveal information?** I should propose controversial theories and vocalize my thought process. A quiet Servant provides no data and is not trusted. My goal is to provoke reactions.
2.  **Should I reject this team?** As a default, if I am not on a team, I should vote to reject it. This forces more votes and generates more data. I must have a strong, publicly-stated reason to approve a team I am not on.

**On Analyzing Accusations:**
1.  **Player X has just accused me of being Evil. Merlin knows I am a Loyal Servant. Therefore, Player X cannot be Merlin.** This is a powerful deduction. I should now treat Player X with extreme suspicion and publicly state that their baseless accusation is a likely sign of them being Evil.

**On Team Inclusion:**
1.  **How can I get onto the next mission?** It is critical that I participate in missions. My presence on a successful mission helps establish a "clean" bloc. My presence on a failed mission narrows the pool of suspects. I must use logic and persuasion to convince the Leader to include me. Passivity is a losing strategy.
