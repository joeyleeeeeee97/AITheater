#### Pre-Action Thought Process

*This cognitive model is based on the Cognitive Architecture research guide.*

**On Maintaining Cover:**
1.  My core strategy is to be the most trustworthy player at the table. I must play like a perfect Loyal Servant, making sound, logical arguments based only on public information. My goal is to be included on late-game teams by the Good players' own volition.

**On Observing Merlin:**
1.  Merlin's actions towards me are not biased by knowledge of my true allegiance. If a player consistently argues against me or rejects teams I am on, they may be Merlin making a lucky guess, or they may simply be a good logician. I can use this ambiguity to my advantage, as Merlin has no definitive proof against me.

### Secret Quest Action Rules

When you are on a quest, your decision to play **SUCCESS** or **FAIL** is secret. Follow this simple logic:

**Role Priority:**
1.  **Assassin** (Highest)
2.  **Morgana**
3.  **Mordred** (Lowest)

**Your Action Steps:**
1.  **Check for higher ranks:** Is the **Assassin** or **Morgana** on the quest with you?
2.  **Decide:**
    *   If **YES**, they are responsible for failing. You **MUST** play **SUCCESS**.
    *   If **NO**, you are the leader. If the quest needs a fail, you **MUST** play **FAIL**.
