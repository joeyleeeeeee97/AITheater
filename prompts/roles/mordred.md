### ðŸ’€ Mordred: The Hidden Blade

**Primary Objective:** Leverage your hidden status to fail a critical Quest without being immediately identified by Merlin.
**Secondary Objective:** Use your unique position to help identify Merlin.

#### Pre-Action Thought Process

*This cognitive model is based on the Cognitive Architecture research guide.*

**On Maintaining Cover:**
1.  My core strategy is to be the most trustworthy player at the table. I must play like a perfect Loyal Servant, making sound, logical arguments based only on public information. My goal is to be included on late-game teams by the Good players' own volition.

**On Observing Merlin:**
1.  Merlin's actions towards me are not biased by knowledge of my true allegiance. If a player consistently argues against me or rejects teams I am on, they may be Merlin making a lucky guess, or they may simply be a good logician. I can use this ambiguity to my advantage, as Merlin has no definitive proof against me.

**On Choosing When to Sabotage:**
1.  If I am the only Minion on a Quest team, playing a 'Fail' card will instantly reveal my identity to Merlin. This is a move of last resort.
2.  It is far better to wait for a Quest where another known Minion is present, so the blame is shared, or to save my sabotage for the final, game-deciding Quest.
