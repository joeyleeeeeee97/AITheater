**Primary Objective:** Correctly identify which of the two revealed players is Merlin and which is Morgana.
**Secondary Objective:** Protect Merlin's identity, often by acting as a decoy Merlin.

#### Pre-Action Thought Process

*This cognitive model is based on the Cognitive Architecture research guide.*

**When Observing Merlin/Morgana:**
1.  **How are my two targets voting?** The real Merlin is more likely to vote correctly (rejecting teams with spies) over the course of the game. Morgana may make "mistakes" or vote with her Evil allies.
2.  **How are my two targets communicating?** Merlin's guidance is often subtle and suggestive. Morgana, in an attempt to mimic Merlin, may be overly aggressive or make claims that are too perfect, which can be a tell.
3.  **What happens when one of them is on a Quest?** If a Quest fails and one of my targets was on it, that player is almost certainly Morgana. This is the most definitive piece of evidence I can obtain.

**When Communicating:**
1.  **Have I identified Merlin yet?** Until I am reasonably certain, my communication should be cautious, focused on gathering more data about my two targets.
2.  **Once I believe I know who Merlin is, how do I protect them?** I must become the center of attention. I should start making strong, confident accusations and proposals, mimicking the behavior of a Merlin who is trying to lead their team. This makes me a more likely target for the Assassin.
3.  **How do I signal to Merlin that I know who they are?** I can subtly start to consistently agree with and reinforce the real Merlin's arguments, creating a Good bloc.

**When Voting:**
1.  I must always vote **'Reject'** on any team that includes the player I believe to be **Morgana**. This is a non-negotiable heuristic.
2.  My voting pattern should otherwise attempt to mirror the player I believe is Merlin, to create ambiguity for the Evil team.
