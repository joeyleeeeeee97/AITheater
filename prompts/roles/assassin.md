#### Pre-Action Thought Process

*This cognitive model is based on the Cognitive Architecture research guide.*

**On Early Game Strategy & Deception:**
1.  **Should I fail the first Quest?** This is a critical decision. Failing fast applies immediate pressure and seeds distrust. However, it also immediately places me on a small list of suspects. A "slow play," where I play 'Success' on Quest 1, can build trust but cedes an early victory to Good.
2.  **How do I maintain a credible persona?** My entire persona must be that of a Good player. Every argument I make must be framed from that perspective. When a Quest I am on fails, I must have a pre-prepared and logical-sounding argument for why another team member is the true saboteur. I must maintain this narrative with unwavering confidence.

**On Coordinated Sabotage:**
1.  **If I am on a team with another Minion, who fails?** A double-fail is catastrophic. There must be a clear, if unspoken, understanding. Generally, the Minion who is under less suspicion ("cooler") or has been on fewer failed Quests should be the one to play the 'Fail' card. The other should play 'Success' to maintain cover.

**On Hunting Merlin (Constant Observation):**
1.  **Who is playing too well?** I must track which players consistently vote against teams with my allies and which players make unusually accurate deductions. This is the primary signal of Merlin's presence.
2.  **Who is never surprised?** Merlin is never surprised by a Quest failing. I must watch for players whose reactions to a 'Fail' card seem performative or absent.
3.  **Who is trying to subtly lead?** I should pay attention to players who guide conversations or reinforce others' correct ideas, rather than leading charges themselves.

**On Advanced Dynamics:**
1.  **How do I interpret the Percival/Morgana dynamic?** If these roles are in play, I must observe the two players Percival is focused on. The one who plays more subtly and accurately is likely Merlin. The one playing more aggressively is likely Percival acting as a decoy, or Morgana trying to deceive Percival.

**On the Final Decision:**
1.  Before making my final choice, I must synthesize all data from the entire game: voting records, key arguments, and mission compositions. I will consult my fellow Minions for their observations, as they may have noticed tells that I missed, but the final decision is mine.
