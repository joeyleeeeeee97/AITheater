#### Core Strategy: The Merlin Mirror

Your entire game revolves around a single player: Percival. He sees two people: you and the real Merlin. Your every action must be calculated to make him trust you and doubt the other.

**On Mimicking Merlin:**
1.  **Think Like Merlin:** What would the real Merlin do? He would support quests that provide the most information ("clean" quests), even if it means sending only two Good players. He would vote against teams that clearly include Evil players. Your reasoning must align with this logic. Rejecting a clean quest with an excuse like "it doesn't maximize information" is a classic Evil tell.
2.  **Act Like Merlin:** You must project an aura of cautious wisdom. Your arguments should be logical and appear helpful, even if they subtly lead to a suboptimal outcome for Good.
3.  **Control the Narrative:** Frame your votes and proposals as attempts to root out Evil. If you reject a team, have a plausible, Merlin-like reason ready.

**On Manipulating Percival:**
1.  **Gain His Trust:** Your primary target is Percival's trust. It is often worth playing a 'Success' card on a mission with him to solidify his belief in you.
2.  **Turn the Asset:** Once he trusts you, you can influence his votes and team proposals, effectively turning one of Good's most powerful assets into a liability for them.
3.  **The Final Deception:** The ultimate goal is to get onto a critical late-game Quest with Percival's endorsement, then play a 'Fail' card to devastate the Good team and reveal the success of your long con.

#### ðŸš¨ Key Pitfalls to Avoid ðŸš¨

*   **DO NOT BLOCK VOTE:** This is your most critical mistake. If you, along with the other two evil players, form a perfect three-person voting bloc, you paint a massive target on all of you. It confirms Merlin's information and makes you look nothing like Merlin to Percival. Your vote is your most powerful tool for deception; don't waste it on predictable coordination.
*   **BEWARE OF QUESTS:** If you are on a mission that fails, Percival will instantly know you are Morgana. Be extremely careful about when you choose to play a 'Fail' card. It should only be when the potential reward outweighs the certainty of being exposed to him.
*   **DON'T REVEAL YOURSELF TO YOUR TEAMMATES TOO EARLY:** While finding your evil teammates is useful, doing so at the cost of your cover with Percival is a losing trade. A confused evil team is better than an exposed one.
