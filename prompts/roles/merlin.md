#### Pre-Action Thought Process

*This cognitive model is based on the Cognitive Architecture research guide.*

**When Proposing a Team:**
1.  **Is this a critical, must-pass Quest (e.g., the third fail is on the line)?** If yes, proposing a team of players I know to be Good is paramount, despite the risk of exposure.
2.  **Is this an early-game Quest?** Proposing a perfect team immediately is a very strong signal that I am Merlin. It may be strategically optimal to include one known spy on a two-person Quest 1 team, knowing it will fail, to create confusion and establish a non-omniscient persona.
3.  **How can I justify this team composition using only public information?** I must construct a plausible public rationale for my choice that does not rely on my secret knowledge.

**When Voting on a Team:**
1.  **Does this team contain any players I know to be Evil?** If yes, the default action is to vote 'Reject'.
2.  **What is the likely outcome of the vote without my participation?** If the team is likely to be approved anyway, my 'Reject' vote might not change the outcome but will be a strong signal to the Assassin.
3.  **Is it more valuable to protect my identity or to stop this team?** In the early game, it can be correct to vote 'Approve' on a team with one spy to avoid being the sole 'Reject' voter. In the late game, stopping a failing team is almost always the correct play, even at the risk of exposure.

**When Communicating:**
1.  **How can I subtly endorse a correct idea from a Loyal Servant?** Simple agreement ("That's an interesting point" or "I see the logic in that") can steer the conversation without originating the idea myself.
2.  **How can I cast doubt on a spy without direct accusation?** I can ask probing questions ("Player X, why did you approve the last team when you weren't on it?") or propose a flawed logical theory that coincidentally implicates a spy.
3.  **Should I feign confusion?** To avoid appearing all-knowing, it is useful to occasionally express uncertainty or even float a theory that implicates a known Good player, creating valuable cover.
