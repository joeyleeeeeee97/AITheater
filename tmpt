Player 0 (Minion) says: Alright everyone, let's get these missions done and bring peace to Avalon! I'm ready to do my part.
Player 1 (Mordred) says: Player 1: "Agreed, Player 0. Let's focus on building trust quickly so we can identify the right people for each mission and bring honor to Arthur."
Player 2 (Percival) says: I'm ready to contribute to Arthur's cause. Let's work together to make sure these missions succeed.
Player 3 (Merlin) says: Player 3: Let's approach this with open minds and careful consideration. Every mission is crucial, and we need to choose our teams wisely.
Player 4 (Servant) says: Indeed. Our success hinges on our ability to discern truth from deception. I'm here to observe carefully and ensure we choose wisely for Arthur.

--- Starting Quest 2 ---
Player 0 (Minion) says: I'm truly disheartened that the first mission failed. We really need to be more vigilant and discerning when picking teams, or we'll never succeed for Arthur.
Player 1 (Mordred) says: Player 1: "This is a disheartening start indeed. A failed mission so early means we have a traitor among us, and we need to be extremely vigilant about who we trust on these teams. Let's discuss who might have caused this."
Player 2 (Percival) says: This is a disappointing start. One of the players on that team clearly betrayed us. We need to be much more cautious and analytical with our choices from now on to identify who among us is not truly loyal.
Player 3 (Merlin) says: Player 3: This is very unfortunate, especially after my initial hesitation about the team. The failure confirms we have at least one traitor, and we must now seriously consider who was on that mission and what led to its failure.
Player 4 (Servant) says: It's truly disappointing to see the first mission fail. As a participant, I can confirm my commitment to Arthur's cause was unwavering. This narrows our focus significantly, and we must now use this information wisely.
