Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. (challengingly) Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\n(confidently) Player 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. (sternly) Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants."

Mission 3 had three members: myself, Player 1, and Player 4. Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, (with finality) Player 4 failed that mission.\n\n(matter-of-factly) The arguments from Player 4 and 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. (suspiciously) It strongly suggests they are working together. \n\n(confidently) Player 3 has proposed the winning team. It is built on the proven loyal core of myself, Player 1, and Player 3, and adds Player 6, who correctly identified the logical flaw in the minions' argument. This is it. This is the team that wins us the game. We approve this, we get our third success. (firmly) Do not fall for the chaos. Vote Approve."

The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. (matter-of-factly) The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur. \n\n(dismissively) The argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it. \n\n(accusingly) What is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner. \n\n(confidently) Player 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win."

Everyone is yelling that the math is simple and that Player 4 is evil. I agree. (thoughtfully) The math *is* simple. Player 4 failed that mission. I accept that. \n\n(with growing suspicion) But what happens next is what matters. Player 6, who has been on zero missions, is suddenly the loudest voice of reason and the final piece of this 'perfect' team?  Let's not forget, I was wrong about Mission 2. I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. (doubtfully) It's too perfect. It's too easy. (pointedly) The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious? (suspiciously) That feels less like sound logic and more like a clever minion getting a free ride to victory."
