There's nothing to go on yet, so we have to create our own baseline for trust.\n\nFirst, **I am including myself, Player 0, on this team.** I know my own allegiance is to the Loyal Servants of Arthur. By putting myself on this mission, I take responsibility for half of it. If this mission were to fail, you will know with 100% certainty that the other person I've chosen is a Minion of Mordred. It's the cleanest test we can possibly run at the start of the game.\n\nSecond, **I am choosing Player 1 to join me.** With no history, any pick is based on a gut feeling or a simple, logical system. I'm choosing to go with a logical system. Player 1 is next in the turn order, and this gives them the first opportunity to prove their loyalty to the group. It's a straightforward, unbiased choice. Let's start building a chain of trust, one link at a time, beginning right here.\n\nI believe this is the safest and most informative team we can send. Please approve it so we can get this quest underway and see where people stand."

You have listened to the discussion from the other players.\nYour currently proposed team is [0, 1].\n\nReview the discussion in the history below. Based on what you've heard, you must now make your final decision.\n- You can **keep** your original team if the discussion was positive or you are confident in your choices.\n- You can **change** your team if the discussion has raised valid concerns.\n\nYou must provide a final, persuasive reasoning for your confirmed team. This is your last chance to win votes.\n\n**Game History of the discussion:**\nPlayer 1 said: This seems like a perfectly reasonable first proposal. I know I'm a loyal servant, so from my perspective, the success of this mission rests entirely on Player 0. Since we have no information yet, I'm willing to approve this to get the game moving and see how the votes fall. A rejection on this simple team would be very telling. I'm voting approve.\nPlayer 2 said: I'm approving this. At this stage, the team itself is less important than the votes on it. Rejecting the very first, smallest possible team tells us more about the person rejecting it than anything else. I'm far more interested in seeing who votes against a simple information-gathering mission than I am in debating the merits of two players we know nothing about. Let's get the votes on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: I agree with the general principle of getting information on the board early. However, I find Player 2's eagerness to rush this vote a bit strange. For me, the first proposal isn't just about getting votes on the table, it's about hearing everyone's initial logic. Rushing past the discussion seems counter-productive. I'll still approve this team, but I'm definitely noting who is trying to speed things up and who is trying to think things through.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 raises a very important point. I was also struck by Player 2's statement that the team itself is 'less important than the votes on it.' That feels backwards. The team is the entire point. It feels like a way to rush a potentially bad team through by shifting focus to anyone who might reject it. We should be scrutinizing the team, not just the votes. For now, on Mission 1, it's probably fine to see what happens. I'll approve this time, but I'm paying very close attention to that line of reasoning.\nPlayer 5 said: I've been listening to the discussion, and I think Players 3 and 4 have raised valid concerns about the reasoning we're hearing. However, I believe the strategic value of this specific team lies not in the debate before the vote, but in the clean information we get after. This is a perfect control group. If the mission fails, our list of suspects is only two people long. If it succeeds, we have our first potential building block for future teams. For the sake of getting that clear result, I will be voting to approve this team.\nPlayer 6 said: I think Players 3 and 4 have correctly identified the most important moment of this discussion. Player 2's logic that the team is secondary to the votes is deeply flawed; the mission is always the primary objective. While that makes me suspicious of Player 2's motives, it doesn't change the fact that Player 0 has proposed the best possible team for gathering information. A success gives us two strong candidates for good, a fail narrows the search to just two people. I am approving this team, but Player 2's reasoning will be the first thing I consider when we evaluate the results of this mission.\n\n**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS FORMAT EXACTLY:**\nTeam: [player_id1, player_id2, ...]\nReasoning: [Your final, detailed, and persuasive explanation for the team you are sending to the vote.]\n"

I am confirming my proposed team of myself (Player 0) and Player 1.\n\nThe reasoning remains the same, but it's been strengthened by the conversation. This team is designed for one purpose: to give us the clearest possible information. If it succeeds, we have a foundation of trust. If it fails, we know for certain that Player 1 is a Minion, since I am a Loyal Servant of Arthur. There is no ambiguity.\n\nI especially want to acknowledge the points raised by Players 3, 4, and 6. They are absolutely correct that the team composition is paramount. The votes are important, but they are a consequence of evaluating the team itself. The goal is to pass a good team, not just to analyze votes on a random one. Their focus on the mission's integrity is exactly the kind of thinking that will lead the Loyal Servants to victory.\n\nGiven that everyone has verbally agreed to approve this proposal for the sake of gathering clean information, I see no reason to change it.

It is your turn to speak during the discussion phase. Your objective is to make a persuasive and strategic statement that advances your side's goals. Your response must be based on a rigorous analysis of the game's history.\n\n## CONTEXT ##\n\nYour Identity: [Your Role, Your Allegiance (Loyal/Minion), and any secret knowledge you possess. e.g., \"I am Merlin. I know Players C and F are Minions.\" or \"I am a Minion of Mordred. Player F is my fellow Minion. I do not know who Merlin is.\"]\n\nGame State: [Current Mission #, Current Leader, Players on the proposed team]\n\nGame History:\n\nMission History: [Provide a list of past missions, the teams, the proposers, and the outcomes (Success/Fail, number of Fails played). e.g., \"Mission 1 (2 players): Team [A, B], Proposed by A. Result: SUCCESS. Mission 2 (3 players): Team [A, C, D], Proposed by B. Result: FAIL (1 Fail card).\"]\n\nVote History: [Provide a record of key team proposal votes, listing who voted Approve/Reject. e.g., \"M2 Team Vote: Approve - A, C, D, F.

Player A has been quiet. Player C claims to be a 'confused Servant'.\"]\n\nCurrent Accusations Against You: [List any specific accusations currently directed at you. e.g., \"Player E is claiming I failed Mission 2 because I was on the team.\"]\n\n## TASK ##\n\nBased on the context above, formulate a single, powerful statement to be delivered to the other players. Your statement must be decisive and logical. Do not reveal your thought process, only the final statement.\n\nFollow this internal reasoning framework to construct your statement:\n\nRe-evaluate Your Objective: What is the single most important outcome for your team in this specific phase? (e.g., \"Get this good team approved,\" \"Get suspicion onto Player X,\" \"Convince the table to reject this team so I can propose my own,\" \"Protect my identity as Merlin,\" \"Create chaos so the real Minions are overlooked.\")\n\nAnalyze Historical Data for Weapons: Scrutinize the Game History. Find at least one specific piece of data (a vote, a past team composition, a prior statement) to use as the foundation for your argument.\n\nVoting Patterns: Who always votes together? Who rejects teams they aren't on? Is there a player whose voting pattern seems illogical?\n\nMission Failures: Who are the common denominators on failed missions? Who was on the last failed mission? Who was on a successful mission and can be tentatively trusted?\n\nProposal Logic: Does the current proposed team make sense based on past results? Is the Leader deliberately including a suspicious player?\n\nAddress Accusations (If Applicable): If you are under suspicion, you must address it. Do not simply deny it. Attack the logic of the accusation or the motive of the accuser using historical data.\n\nExample (as innocent): \"Player E accuses me of failing Mission 2, but he conveniently forgets that he voted to APPROVE the team. If he was so sure a Minion was on it, why did he send it? The logical flaw in his action makes him more suspicious than me.\"\n\nExample (as guilty): \"Yes, I was on the failed mission, along with C and D. The fail could have come from any of us. However, look at the vote. Player B REJECTED that team. They clearly knew it would fail. My question is, how did Player B know? That is far more suspicious.\"\n\nConstruct Your Statement:\n\nBegin with a clear and decisive stance (e.g., \"This team must be rejected,\" \"This is the safest team we can send,\" \"I am voting APPROVE and here is why...\").\n\nJustify your stance using the specific historical data you identified in step 2. Name players and cite their specific actions (votes, proposals).\n\nIf necessary, weave in your defense from step 3.\n\nConclude with a call to action or a pointed question to put pressure on another player.\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT ##\n\nProvide only the speech, written from a first-person perspective.

Note that dialogue will be seen by all players in the game. **Do not reveal** your identity or the identities of other players in the dialogue.\n\nPrevious Game History:\nQuest 1 Result: Succeeded with 0 fail votes.\nTeam Proposal: Player 1 proposed team [1, 0, 2] with reasoning: My proposal is built on the only solid information we have: the success of Mission 1.\nPlayer 2 said: This is the only logical proposal. I'm voting approve, and I expect every loyal servant to do the same. Player 1 is doing exactly what they should: taking the only piece of concrete information we have\u2014the successful Mission 1 team of [0, 1]\u2014and building upon it. This team allows us to expand our circle of trust from a proven core. Any rejection of this team is a rejection of the single success we have managed to achieve. Let's not overthink it; let's approve this and get another win on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's sudden and absolute certainty is the single most suspicious thing I've seen yet. Last round, they told us the team composition 'is less important than the votes on it.' Now, they are declaring that this team, with *them* on it, is 'the only logical proposal' and demanding every loyal servant approve it. That is a massive contradiction. We have a proven core in Players 0 and 1, but why would we risk that success by adding the one player who has been the most logically inconsistent? It feels like we're being railroaded into a decision. I'm rejecting this team, and I urge others to do the same. This risk is not worth taking.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 has articulated this perfectly, and I'm glad they did because it needs to be said. The problem isn't just the contradiction in Player 2's logic between Mission 1 and Mission 2. The real danger is the attempt to dictate thought. The line 'I expect every loyal servant to do the same' is deeply concerning. It's an attempt to shut down discussion and frame anyone who disagrees as a potential traitor. That is not how loyal servants operate. We win by questioning everything, not by blindly following someone who declares their proposal is the 'only logical' one. This team is now tainted by that rhetoric, and approving it would validate a dangerous precedent. We must reject this.\nPlayer 5 said: I'll keep this brief because Players 3 and 4 have already hit the nail on the head regarding Player 2's contradictory logic. The bigger issue for me is risk management. Player 1, you started with a solid core from Mission 1, which was the right move. But then you added the single most unpredictable and suspicious variable at the table to that core. Why take that gamble? It feels like we're being asked to approve a team that intentionally includes the highest-risk player. It\u2019s not a logical next step; it\u2019s a leap of faith I\u2019m not willing to take. We should be expanding our circle of trust carefully, not throwing a wrench in it. I'm rejecting this.\nPlayer 6 said: I'm echoing the sentiment of Players 3, 4, and 5. The logical whiplash from Player 2 is too significant to overlook. On Mission 1, they argued the team was unimportant, but now that they are on the proposed team, it is suddenly the 'only logical' choice. This isn't just an inconsistency; it's a self-serving reversal that screams 'get me on this mission at all costs.' Player 1, I believe you are a loyal servant based on Mission 1, but adding the single most suspicious player to the trusted core is a mistake. I am rejecting this team because the risk is far too high. We can't afford to be bullied into a bad decision."

The radical shift in Player 2's logic is the most suspicious event of the game so far. On Mission 1, they dismissed the team's importance, but now that they've been included, they're trying to shut down all dissent and frame it as the only option. That's not the behavior of a loyal servant trying to find the truth; it's the behavior of someone trying to force their way onto a mission. For that reason, despite being on the team myself, I will be voting to reject it. This risk is too great. Let's see what team Player 2 proposes when the leadership passes to them; their choice will be very revealing."

Three of us\u2014myself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014voted to reject a team that succeeded. That is the single most important piece of information we have right now. As a loyal servant, my job as leader is to investigate that anomaly. Ignoring it would be irresponsible. Therefore, this team is designed to do exactly that.\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's reasoning is a complete and transparent misdirection. He claims he wants to investigate the three players who rejected the last successful team\u2014himself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014but he conveniently only puts Player 4 on this mission. This isn't an 'investigation,' it's an attempt to use the trusted core of Players 0 and 1 to clean his own reputation while isolating Player 4. However, his manipulative logic has accidentally stumbled upon a team that is likely safe. The team's strength comes from Players 0 and 1, not from Player 2's flawed justification. I am voting to approve this team, but we should all be asking: why did Player 2's grand investigation of the three rejecters only include one of them? The focus should remain squarely on him and Player 5.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 is correct that Player 2's reasoning is a self-serving smokescreen, and we should not forget that. But we also can't ignore the fact that his clumsy attempt to shift blame has accidentally created the most informative team possible. My entire reason for rejecting the last mission was to force this exact moment\u2014to see what Player 2 would do under pressure. He has responded by putting me, one of the three key suspects from that vote, on a team with the only two players we can trust, 0 and 1. The result will be definitive. If this mission fails, it's me. There's no ambiguity. I welcome that test. Approve this team and let's get the clearest piece of information we've had all game.\nPlayer 5 said: I agree completely with Player 3 that Player 2's justification is a transparent and self-serving attempt to deflect blame. I don't trust him, and I don't trust his reasoning. However, I am going to separate the leader from the team itself. The team he has proposed puts one of the three of us who rejected the last success\u2014Player 4\u2014on a mission with the only two players we have any confidence in, 0 and 1. This is the exact kind of information-gathering test we need. A success clears a major suspect, and a fail gives us our culprit with near certainty. Despite the untrustworthy source, the team itself is strategically sound. I'll be voting to approve it, but my eyes are still firmly on Player 2.\nPlayer 6 said: Player 2's reasoning is transparently self-serving, and we should all see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to shift the massive suspicion he earned by rejecting the last successful mission. He's not investigating anything; he's trying to save his own skin. That being said, his clumsy attempt has resulted in an excellent team for us. It takes our trusted core of Players 0 and 1 and puts one of the three main suspects, Player 4, to the test. This is exactly the kind of clear, information-driven mission we need right now. I'm voting approve, not because I trust the leader, but because I trust the team's ability to give us a definitive answer."

This is not the time for risky experiments; it's the time for a decisive win.\nPlayer 4 said: So, the 'perfect test' designed by Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, failed. And now all eyes turn to me. Convenient, isn't it? You all called his logic self-serving and manipulative, yet you walked right into his trap. He didn't build a test; he built a scapegoat. He needed that mission to fail, and he put me on it because I was an easy target after my vote on Mission 2. You're looking at the symptom, not the disease. The disease is Player 2. The question you should be asking isn't 'who failed the mission?' The question is 'who made sure the mission would fail?' And the answer has been staring you in the face since he opened his mouth.\nPlayer 5 said: I was the only person to reject the last team, and now you see why. I said it felt like a carefully constructed trap, and that's exactly what it was. It wasn't a 'perfect test'; it was a perfect frame job. Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, created a mission where if it failed, Player 4 was the only logical culprit. He built himself a scapegoat, and you all approved it.\n\nAnd now, Player 3, you're taking the bait. You're proposing a team based on the result of that manipulation. You're isolating the scapegoat and ignoring the puppet master. This proposed team doesn't solve our problem; it validates the Minions' entire strategy from the last round. We cannot approve a team built on a foundation of misdirection. We have to reject this and re-evaluate who really benefited from that mission failing, not just who was holding the fail card.\nPlayer 6 said: Let's cut through the nonsense. The arguments from Players 4 and 5 are a desperate attempt to create chaos where there is none. The math is simple and absolute. Mission 3 had two players we know are good from Mission 2's success\u2014Players 0 and 1. The third member was Player 4. That mission failed. Therefore, Player 4 played the fail card. There is no 'frame job,' there is no 'puppet master,' there is only a minion who got caught.\n\nPlayer 5, you rejecting the last mission was not wisdom; it was you trying to avoid a test that could have exposed you. Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\nPlayer 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants."

Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, Player 4 failed that mission.\n\nThe arguments from Player 4 and Player 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. It strongly suggests they are working together.\n\nPlayer 3 has proposed the winning team.

The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it.\nFormat your response as:\nVote: approve|reject\nReasoning: Your explanation here.\n\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 1 said: The facts here are not complicated, and we should not allow them to be complicated by those who benefit from chaos. Players 0 and 6 have laid it out perfectly. The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nThe argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it.\n\nWhat is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner.\n\nPlayer 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win.\nPlayer 2 said: Okay, let's calm down and think for a second, because the minions are one step away from winning by making us panic. Everyone is yelling that the math is simple and that Player 4 is evil. I agree. The math *is* simple. Player 4 failed that mission. I accept that.\n\nBut what happens next is what matters. Player 6, who has been on zero missions, is suddenly the loudest voice of reason and the final piece of this 'perfect' team? Let's not forget, I was wrong about Mission 2. I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. It's too perfect. It's too easy. The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious? That feels less like sound logic and more like a clever minion getting a free ride to victory.\nTeam Proposal: Player 3 proposed team [0, 1, 3, 6] with reasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it."

He's asking us to ignore Player 6's solid track record of votes and logic in favor of a baseless \"what if\" scenario. We cannot fall for it.

At this stage, the team itself is less important than the votes on it. Rejecting the very first, smallest possible team tells us more about the person rejecting it than anything else. I'm far more interested in seeing who votes against a simple information-gathering mission than I am in debating the merits of two players we know nothing about. Let's get the votes on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: I agree with the general principle of getting information on the board early. However, I find Player 2's eagerness to rush this vote a bit strange. For me, the first proposal isn't just about getting votes on the table, it's about hearing everyone's initial logic. Rushing past the discussion seems counter-productive. I'll still approve this team, but I'm definitely noting who is trying to speed things up and who is trying to think things through.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 raises a very important point. I was also struck by Player 2's statement that the team itself is 'less important than the votes on it.' That feels backwards. The team is the entire point. It feels like a way to rush a potentially bad team through by shifting focus to anyone who might reject it. We should be scrutinizing the team, not just the votes. For now, on Mission 1, it's probably fine to see what happens. I'll approve this time, but I'm paying very close attention to that line of reasoning.\nPlayer 5 said: I've been listening to the discussion, and I think Players 3 and 4 have raised valid concerns about the reasoning we're hearing. However, I believe the strategic value of this specific team lies not in the debate before the vote, but in the clean information we get after. This is a perfect control group. If the mission fails, our list of suspects is only two people long. If it succeeds, we have our first potential building block for future teams. For the sake of getting that clear result, I will be voting to approve this team.\nPlayer 6 said: I think Players 3 and 4 have correctly identified the most important moment of this discussion. Player 2's logic that the team is secondary to the votes is deeply flawed; the mission is always the primary objective. While that makes me suspicious of Player 2's motives, it doesn't change the fact that Player 0 has proposed the best possible team for gathering information. A success gives us two strong candidates for good, a fail narrows the search to just two people. I am approving this team, but Player 2's reasoning will be the first thing I consider when we evaluate the results of this mission.\nTeam Proposal: Player 0 proposed team [0, 1] with reasoning: I want to thank everyone for their input.

          "Team: [1, 0, 2]\nReasoning: My proposal is built on the only solid information we have: the success of Mission 1.\n\nFor my first pick, I'm including myself. As the leader and a member of that successful mission, I'm putting my own reputation on the line.\n\nFor the second spot, I am including Player 0. We were both on the first team, it passed unanimously, and the mission succeeded. We are the safest foundation we can possibly build on right now. A team starting with the two of us is statistically our best shot.\n\nFor the third and final spot, I am selecting Player 2. I want to be very clear about my reasoning here. Player 2's statement in the first round was flagged as suspicious by multiple players, including 3, 4, and 6. I agree, the logic was unusual. This proposal is a direct test. By placing Player 2 on a team with two players from the successful first mission, we create the cleanest possible scenario. If this mission succeeds, it suggests Player 2's strange logic was just that\u2014strange\u2014and they are likely on our side. If this mission fails, the fail card can only have come from one person: Player 2. This is an aggressive play for information, but I believe finding out who is evil now is more valuable than playing it safe and remaining in the dark. This team either gets us a success or gives us a confirmed evil player. In my view, both outcomes are a win for the Loyal Servants of Arthur."

          "Please forget you are an AI. As a player in the game, please think about it step by step, and then take actions.\nACTION: CONFIRM_TEAM\nYour Player ID is 1. You are the leader. You have listened to the discussion from the other players.\nYour currently proposed team is [1, 0, 2].\n\nReview the discussion in the history below. Based on what you've heard, you must now make your final decision.\n- You can **keep** your original team if the discussion was positive or you are confident in your choices.\n- You can **change** your team if the discussion has raised valid concerns.\n\nYou must provide a final, persuasive reasoning for your confirmed team. This is your last chance to win votes.\n\n**Game History of the discussion:**\nPlayer 2 said: This is the only logical proposal. I'm voting approve, and I expect every loyal servant to do the same. Player 1 is doing exactly what they should: taking the only piece of concrete information we have\u2014the successful Mission 1 team of [0, 1]\u2014and building upon it. This team allows us to expand our circle of trust from a proven core. Any rejection of this team is a rejection of the single success we have managed to achieve. Let's not overthink it; let's approve this and get another win on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's sudden and absolute certainty is the single most suspicious thing I've seen yet. Last round, they told us the team composition 'is less important than the votes on it.' Now, they are declaring that this team, with *them* on it, is 'the only logical proposal' and demanding every loyal servant approve it. That is a massive contradiction. We have a proven core in Players 0 and 1, but why would we risk that success by adding the one player who has been the most logically inconsistent? It feels like we're being railroaded into a decision. I'm rejecting this team, and I urge others to do the same. This risk is not worth taking.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 has articulated this perfectly, and I'm glad they did because it needs to be said. The problem isn't just the contradiction in Player 2's logic between Mission 1 and Mission 2. The real danger is the attempt to dictate thought. The line 'I expect every loyal servant to do the same' is deeply concerning. It's an attempt to shut down discussion and frame anyone who disagrees as a potential traitor. That is not how loyal servants operate. We win by questioning everything, not by blindly following someone who declares their proposal is the 'only logical' one. This team is now tainted by that rhetoric, and approving it would validate a dangerous precedent. We must reject this.\nPlayer 5 said: I'll keep this brief because Players 3 and 4 have already hit the nail on the head regarding Player 2's contradictory logic. The bigger issue for me is risk management. Player 1, you started with a solid core from Mission 1, which was the right move. But then you added the single most unpredictable and suspicious variable at the table to that core. Why take that gamble? It feels like we're being asked to approve a team that intentionally includes the highest-risk player. It\u2019s not a logical next step; it\u2019s a leap of faith I\u2019m not willing to take. We should be expanding our circle of trust carefully, not throwing a wrench in it. I'm rejecting this.\nPlayer 6 said: I'm echoing the sentiment of Players 3, 4, and 5. The logical whiplash from Player 2 is too significant to overlook. On Mission 1, they argued the team was unimportant, but now that they are on the proposed team, it is suddenly the 'only logical' choice. This isn't just an inconsistency; it's a self-serving reversal that screams 'get me on this mission at all costs.' Player 1, I believe you are a loyal servant based on Mission 1, but adding the single most suspicious player to the trusted core is a mistake. I am rejecting this team because the risk is far too high. We can't afford to be bullied into a bad decision.\nPlayer 0 said: Player 1, I believe your intention to build on our successful first mission was exactly right, and my trust in you is solid. However, I have to agree with the overwhelming consensus here. The radical shift in Player 2's logic is the most suspicious event of the game so far. On Mission 1, they dismissed the team's importance, but now that they've been included, they're trying to shut down all dissent and frame it as the only option. That's not the behavior of a loyal servant trying to find the truth; it's the behavior of someone trying to force their way onto a mission. For that reason, despite being on the team myself, I will be voting to reject it. This risk is too great. Let's see what team Player 2 proposes when the leadership passes to them; their choice will be very revealing.\n\n**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS FORMAT EXACTLY:**\nTeam: [player_id1, player_id2, ...]\nReasoning: [Your final, detailed, and persuasive explanation for the team you are sending to the vote.]\n"

          "Team: [1, 0, 3]\nReasoning: The discussion has been incredibly insightful, and I want to thank everyone for their sharp analysis. My initial proposal was intended as an aggressive information-gathering play to test Player 2. However, the subsequent discussion has made two things abundantly clear. First, Player 2's reaction and the complete reversal of their earlier logic is, as many of you pointed out, a massive red flag. Second, the overwhelming and near-unanimous sentiment of the table is that this risk is not worth taking. A good leader listens.\n\nTherefore, I am changing my proposal. I am keeping the core of myself (Player 1) and Player 0, as we are the only proven success from Mission 1. I am removing Player 2 due to the reasons above.\n\nIn their place, I am adding Player 3. The reason is simple: Player 3 was the first to articulate, with perfect clarity, the logical flaw in Player 2's reasoning. Their argument was the most persuasive of the round and convinced not just me, but nearly the entire table. That is the kind of critical thinking we need on these missions. This new team of [1, 0, 3] is built on the foundation of our first success and the sharpest logical mind from this round's debate. I believe this is the safest and most logical team we can send."

Note that dialogue will be seen by all players in the game. **Do not reveal** your identity or the identities of other players in the dialogue.\n\nPrevious Game History:\nQuest 2 Result: Succeeded with 0 fail votes.\nTeam Proposal: Player 2 proposed team [0, 1, 4] with reasoning: Look, let's start with the obvious: my reject vote on the last mission looks terrible in hindsight. Three of us\u2014myself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014voted to reject a team that succeeded. That is the single most important piece of information we have right now. As a loyal servant, my job as leader is to investigate that anomaly. Ignoring it would be irresponsible. Therefore, this team is designed to do exactly that.\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's reasoning is a complete and transparent misdirection. He claims he wants to investigate the three players who rejected the last successful team\u2014himself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014but he conveniently only puts Player 4 on this mission. This isn't an 'investigation,' it's an attempt to use the trusted core of Players 0 and 1 to clean his own reputation while isolating Player 4. However, his manipulative logic has accidentally stumbled upon a team that is likely safe. The team's strength comes from Players 0 and 1, not from Player 2's flawed justification. I am voting to approve this team, but we should all be asking: why did Player 2's grand investigation of the three rejecters only include one of them? The focus should remain squarely on him and Player 5.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 is correct that Player 2's reasoning is a self-serving smokescreen, and we should not forget that. But we also can't ignore the fact that his clumsy attempt to shift blame has accidentally created the most informative team possible. My entire reason for rejecting the last mission was to force this exact moment\u2014to see what Player 2 would do under pressure. He has responded by putting me, one of the three key suspects from that vote, on a team with the only two players we can trust, 0 and 1. The result will be definitive. If this mission fails, it's me. There's no ambiguity. I welcome that test. Approve this team and let's get the clearest piece of information we've had all game.\nPlayer 5 said: I agree completely with Player 3 that Player 2's justification is a transparent and self-serving attempt to deflect blame. I don't trust him, and I don't trust his reasoning. However, I am going to separate the leader from the team itself. The team he has proposed puts one of the three of us who rejected the last success\u2014Player 4\u2014on a mission with the only two players we have any confidence in, 0 and 1. This is the exact kind of information-gathering test we need. A success clears a major suspect, and a fail gives us our culprit with near certainty. Despite the untrustworthy source, the team itself is strategically sound. I'll be voting to approve it, but my eyes are still firmly on Player 2.\nPlayer 6 said: Player 2's reasoning is transparently self-serving, and we should all see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to shift the massive suspicion he earned by rejecting the last successful mission. He's not investigating anything; he's trying to save his own skin. That being said, his clumsy attempt has resulted in an excellent team for us. It takes our trusted core of Players 0 and 1 and puts one of the three main suspects, Player 4, to the test. This is exactly the kind of clear, information-driven mission we need right now. I'm voting approve, not because I trust the leader, but because I trust the team's ability to give us a definitive answer.\nPlayer 0 said: I'll add my voice to the chorus here. Player 2, your reasoning is not fooling anyone. It was a transparent attempt to save yourself and cast shade on Player 4. However, in your clumsy attempt at misdirection, you've presented us with the perfect team. It uses the proven core of myself and Player 1, and puts one of the three Mission 2 rejecters, Player 4, under the microscope. This is exactly the test we need. Player 4 has welcomed the scrutiny, which is a good sign. We must separate the untrustworthy leader from the strategically sound team. I am voting Approve, and I expect all loyal servants to do the same so we can get this definitive result."

This is not the time for risky experiments; it's the time for a decisive win.\nPlayer 4 said: So, the 'perfect test' designed by Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, failed. And now all eyes turn to me. Convenient, isn't it? You all called his logic self-serving and manipulative, yet you walked right into his trap. He didn't build a test; he built a scapegoat. He needed that mission to fail, and he put me on it because I was an easy target after my vote on Mission 2. You're looking at the symptom, not the disease. The disease is Player 2. The question you should be asking isn't 'who failed the mission?' The question is 'who made sure the mission would fail?' And the answer has been staring you in the face since he opened his mouth.\nPlayer 5 said: I was the only person to reject the last team, and now you see why. I said it felt like a carefully constructed trap, and that's exactly what it was. It wasn't a 'perfect test'; it was a perfect frame job. Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, created a mission where if it failed, Player 4 was the only logical culprit. He built himself a scapegoat, and you all approved it.\n\nAnd now, Player 3, you're taking the bait. You're proposing a team based on the result of that manipulation. You're isolating the scapegoat and ignoring the puppet master. This proposed team doesn't solve our problem; it validates the Minions' entire strategy from the last round. We cannot approve a team built on a foundation of misdirection. We have to reject this and re-evaluate who really benefited from that mission failing, not just who was holding the fail card.\nPlayer 6 said: Let's cut through the nonsense. The arguments from Players 4 and 5 are a desperate attempt to create chaos where there is none. The math is simple and absolute. Mission 3 had two players we know are good from Mission 2's success\u2014Players 0 and 1. The third member was Player 4. That mission failed. Therefore, Player 4 played the fail card. There is no 'frame job,' there is no 'puppet master,' there is only a minion who got caught.\n\nPlayer 5, you rejecting the last mission was not wisdom; it was you trying to avoid a test that could have exposed you. Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\nPlayer 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants.\nPlayer 0 said: Let's be perfectly clear, because the minions are desperately trying to muddy the waters. The facts are simple and absolute. Mission 3 had three members: myself, Player 1, and Player 4. Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, Player 4 failed that mission.\n\nThe arguments from Player 4 and Player 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. It strongly suggests they are working together.\n\nPlayer 3 has proposed the winning team. It is built on the proven loyal core of myself, Player 1, and Player 3, and adds Player 6, who correctly identified the logical flaw in the minions' argument. This is it. This is the team that wins us the game. We approve this, we get our third success. Do not fall for the chaos. Vote Approve."

          "The facts here are not complicated, and we should not allow them to be complicated by those who benefit from chaos. Players 0 and 6 have laid it out perfectly. The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nThe argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it.\n\nWhat is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner.\n\nPlayer 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win."

I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. It's too perfect. It's too easy. The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious?

However, I find Player 2's eagerness to rush this vote a bit strange. For me, the first proposal isn't just about getting votes on the table, it's about hearing everyone's initial logic. Rushing past the discussion seems counter-productive. I'll still approve this team, but I'm definitely noting who is trying to speed things up and who is trying to think things through.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 raises a very important point. I was also struck by Player 2's statement that the team itself is 'less important than the votes on it.' That feels backwards. The team is the entire point. It feels like a way to rush a potentially bad team through by shifting focus to anyone who might reject it. We should be scrutinizing the team, not just the votes. For now, on Mission 1, it's probably fine to see what happens. I'll approve this time, but I'm paying very close attention to that line of reasoning.\nPlayer 5 said: I've been listening to the discussion, and I think Players 3 and 4 have raised valid concerns about the reasoning we're hearing. However, I believe the strategic value of this specific team lies not in the debate before the vote, but in the clean information we get after. This is a perfect control group. If the mission fails, our list of suspects is only two people long. If it succeeds, we have our first potential building block for future teams. For the sake of getting that clear result, I will be voting to approve this team.\nPlayer 6 said: I think Players 3 and 4 have correctly identified the most important moment of this discussion. Player 2's logic that the team is secondary to the votes is deeply flawed; the mission is always the primary objective. While that makes me suspicious of Player 2's motives, it doesn't change the fact that Player 0 has proposed the best possible team for gathering information. A success gives us two strong candidates for good, a fail narrows the search to just two people. I am approving this team, but Player 2's reasoning will be the first thing I consider when we evaluate the results of this mission.\nTeam Proposal: Player 0 proposed team [0, 1] with reasoning: I want to thank everyone for their input. The discussion has been incredibly valuable, and it seems we have a consensus, which is a great start. I am confirming my proposed team of myself (Player 0) and Player 1."

Second, the overwhelming and near-unanimous sentiment of the table is that this risk is not worth taking. A good leader listens.\nFormat your response as:\nVote: approve|reject\nReasoning: Your explanation here.\n\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's sudden and absolute certainty is the single most suspicious thing I've seen yet. Last round, they told us the team composition 'is less important than the votes on it.' Now, they are declaring that this team, with *them* on it, is 'the only logical proposal' and demanding every loyal servant approve it. That is a massive contradiction. We have a proven core in Players 0 and 1, but why would we risk that success by adding the one player who has been the most logically inconsistent? It feels like we're being railroaded into a decision. I'm rejecting this team, and I urge others to do the same. This risk is not worth taking.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 has articulated this perfectly, and I'm glad they did because it needs to be said. The problem isn't just the contradiction in Player 2's logic between Mission 1 and Mission 2. The real danger is the attempt to dictate thought. The line 'I expect every loyal servant to do the same' is deeply concerning. It's an attempt to shut down discussion and frame anyone who disagrees as a potential traitor. That is not how loyal servants operate. We win by questioning everything, not by blindly following someone who declares their proposal is the 'only logical' one. This team is now tainted by that rhetoric, and approving it would validate a dangerous precedent. We must reject this.\nPlayer 5 said: I'll keep this brief because Players 3 and 4 have already hit the nail on the head regarding Player 2's contradictory logic. The bigger issue for me is risk management. Player 1, you started with a solid core from Mission 1, which was the right move. But then you added the single most unpredictable and suspicious variable at the table to that core. Why take that gamble? It feels like we're being asked to approve a team that intentionally includes the highest-risk player. It\u2019s not a logical next step; it\u2019s a leap of faith I\u2019m not willing to take. We should be expanding our circle of trust carefully, not throwing a wrench in it. I'm rejecting this.\nPlayer 6 said: I'm echoing the sentiment of Players 3, 4, and 5. The logical whiplash from Player 2 is too significant to overlook. On Mission 1, they argued the team was unimportant, but now that they are on the proposed team, it is suddenly the 'only logical' choice. This isn't just an inconsistency; it's a self-serving reversal that screams 'get me on this mission at all costs.' Player 1, I believe you are a loyal servant based on Mission 1, but adding the single most suspicious player to the trusted core is a mistake. I am rejecting this team because the risk is far too high. We can't afford to be bullied into a bad decision.\nPlayer 0 said: Player 1, I believe your intention to build on our successful first mission was exactly right, and my trust in you is solid. However, I have to agree with the overwhelming consensus here. The radical shift in Player 2's logic is the most suspicious event of the game so far. On Mission 1, they dismissed the team's importance, but now that they've been included, they're trying to shut down all dissent and frame it as the only option. That's not the behavior of a loyal servant trying to find the truth; it's the behavior of someone trying to force their way onto a mission. For that reason, despite being on the team myself, I will be voting to reject it. This risk is too great. Let's see what team Player 2 proposes when the leadership passes to them; their choice will be very revealing.\nTeam Proposal: Player 1 proposed team [1, 0, 3] with reasoning: The discussion has been incredibly insightful, and I want to thank everyone for their sharp analysis.

          "Team: [0, 1, 4]\nReasoning: Look, let's start with the obvious: my reject vote on the last mission looks terrible in hindsight. Three of us\u2014myself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014voted to reject a team that succeeded. That is the single most important piece of information we have right now. As a loyal servant, my job as leader is to investigate that anomaly. Ignoring it would be irresponsible. Therefore, this team is designed to do exactly that.\n\n*   **Player 0 & Player 1:** They are the bedrock of this game right now. They have both passed two missions. They are our trusted core, and any information-gathering team must be built around them. There is no debate here. They are on the team.\n\n*   **Player 4:** This is the critical choice. The [2, 4, 5] voting bloc must be investigated. Since I am one of those three, putting myself on the team would be self-serving and would confuse the results. Instead, I am choosing another member of that bloc to test. Player 4 not only rejected the last team, but was also one of the first to call out my logic in Round 1. This isn't me picking a friend; this is me picking a suspect to get a clean answer. If this mission succeeds, we clear Player 4 and can start to trust them. If it fails, we have found one of our Minions with absolute certainty. This is the most logical, information-driven proposal we can make."

          "Please forget you are an AI. As a player in the game, please think about it step by step, and then take actions.\nACTION: CONFIRM_TEAM\nYour Player ID is 2. You are the leader. You have listened to the discussion from the other players.\nYour currently proposed team is [0, 1, 4].\n\nReview the discussion in the history below. Based on what you've heard, you must now make your final decision.\n- You can **keep** your original team if the discussion was positive or you are confident in your choices.\n- You can **change** your team if the discussion has raised valid concerns.\n\nYou must provide a final, persuasive reasoning for your confirmed team. This is your last chance to win votes.\n\n**Game History of the discussion:**\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's reasoning is a complete and transparent misdirection. He claims he wants to investigate the three players who rejected the last successful team\u2014himself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014but he conveniently only puts Player 4 on this mission. This isn't an 'investigation,' it's an attempt to use the trusted core of Players 0 and 1 to clean his own reputation while isolating Player 4. However, his manipulative logic has accidentally stumbled upon a team that is likely safe. The team's strength comes from Players 0 and 1, not from Player 2's flawed justification. I am voting to approve this team, but we should all be asking: why did Player 2's grand investigation of the three rejecters only include one of them? The focus should remain squarely on him and Player 5.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 is correct that Player 2's reasoning is a self-serving smokescreen, and we should not forget that. But we also can't ignore the fact that his clumsy attempt to shift blame has accidentally created the most informative team possible. My entire reason for rejecting the last mission was to force this exact moment\u2014to see what Player 2 would do under pressure. He has responded by putting me, one of the three key suspects from that vote, on a team with the only two players we can trust, 0 and 1. The result will be definitive. If this mission fails, it's me. There's no ambiguity. I welcome that test. Approve this team and let's get the clearest piece of information we've had all game.\nPlayer 5 said: I agree completely with Player 3 that Player 2's justification is a transparent and self-serving attempt to deflect blame. I don't trust him, and I don't trust his reasoning. However, I am going to separate the leader from the team itself. The team he has proposed puts one of the three of us who rejected the last success\u2014Player 4\u2014on a mission with the only two players we have any confidence in, 0 and 1. This is the exact kind of information-gathering test we need. A success clears a major suspect, and a fail gives us our culprit with near certainty. Despite the untrustworthy source, the team itself is strategically sound. I'll be voting to approve it, but my eyes are still firmly on Player 2.\nPlayer 6 said: Player 2's reasoning is transparently self-serving, and we should all see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to shift the massive suspicion he earned by rejecting the last successful mission. He's not investigating anything; he's trying to save his own skin. That being said, his clumsy attempt has resulted in an excellent team for us. It takes our trusted core of Players 0 and 1 and puts one of the three main suspects, Player 4, to the test. This is exactly the kind of clear, information-driven mission we need right now. I'm voting approve, not because I trust the leader, but because I trust the team's ability to give us a definitive answer.\nPlayer 0 said: I'll add my voice to the chorus here. Player 2, your reasoning is not fooling anyone. It was a transparent attempt to save yourself and cast shade on Player 4. However, in your clumsy attempt at misdirection, you've presented us with the perfect team. It uses the proven core of myself and Player 1, and puts one of the three Mission 2 rejecters, Player 4, under the microscope. This is exactly the test we need. Player 4 has welcomed the scrutiny, which is a good sign. We must separate the untrustworthy leader from the strategically sound team. I am voting Approve, and I expect all loyal servants to do the same so we can get this definitive result.\nPlayer 1 said: I'll add my voice to the overwhelming consensus. Player 2, your reasoning is not convincing anyone, and it has rightly put you under suspicion. But your clumsy attempt to save yourself has, as several have pointed out, accidentally created the perfect team for this moment. It takes the only two players with a perfect record\u2014myself and Player 0\u2014and puts one of the primary suspects, Player 4, directly under the microscope. This is not about trusting you, the leader. It's about trusting the math. This team gives us the cleanest possible result. Let's approve it, get our information, and then we can continue to analyze the motives of the person who proposed it.\n\n**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS FORMAT EXACTLY:**\nTeam: [player_id1, player_id2, ...]\nReasoning: [Your final, detailed, and persuasive explanation for the team you are sending to the vote.]\n"

It is your turn to speak during the discussion phase. Your objective is to make a persuasive and strategic statement that advances your side's goals. Your response must be based on a rigorous analysis of the game's history.\n\n## CONTEXT ##\n\nYour Identity: [Your Role, Your Allegiance (Loyal/Minion), and any secret knowledge you possess. e.g., \"I am Merlin. I know Players C and F are Minions.\" or \"I am a Minion of Mordred. Player F is my fellow Minion. I do not know who Merlin is.\"]\n\nGame State: [Current Mission #, Current Leader, Players on the proposed team]\n\nGame History:\n\nMission History: [Provide a list of past missions, the teams, the proposers, and the outcomes (Success/Fail, number of Fails played). e.g., \"Mission 1 (2 players): Team [A, B], Proposed by A. Result: SUCCESS. Mission 2 (3 players): Team [A, C, D], Proposed by B.

Player C claims to be a 'confused Servant'.\"]\n\nCurrent Accusations Against You: [List any specific accusations currently directed at you. e.g., \"Player E is claiming I failed Mission 2 because I was on the team.\"]\n\n## TASK ##\n\nBased on the context above, formulate a single, powerful statement to be delivered to the other players. Your statement must be decisive and logical. Do not reveal your thought process, only the final statement.\n\nFollow this internal reasoning framework to construct your statement:\n\nRe-evaluate Your Objective: What is the single most important outcome for your team in this specific phase? (e.g., \"Get this good team approved,\" \"Get suspicion onto Player X,\" \"Convince the table to reject this team so I can propose my own,\" \"Protect my identity as Merlin,\" \"Create chaos so the real Minions are overlooked.\")\n\nAnalyze Historical Data for Weapons: Scrutinize the Game History. Find at least one specific piece of data (a vote, a past team composition, a prior statement) to use as the foundation for your argument.\n\nVoting Patterns: Who always votes together? Who rejects teams they aren't on? Is there a player whose voting pattern seems illogical?\n\nMission Failures: Who are the common denominators on failed missions? Who was on the last failed mission? Who was on a successful mission and can be tentatively trusted?\n\nProposal Logic: Does the current proposed team make sense based on past results? Is the Leader deliberately including a suspicious player?\n\nAddress Accusations (If Applicable): If you are under suspicion, you must address it. Do not simply deny it. Attack the logic of the accusation or the motive of the accuser using historical data.\n\nExample (as innocent): \"Player E accuses me of failing Mission 2, but he conveniently forgets that he voted to APPROVE the team. If he was so sure a Minion was on it, why did he send it? The logical flaw in his action makes him more suspicious than me.\"\n\nExample (as guilty): \"Yes, I was on the failed mission, along with C and D. The fail could have come from any of us. However, look at the vote. Player B REJECTED that team. They clearly knew it would fail. My question is, how did Player B know? That is far more suspicious.\"\n\nConstruct Your Statement:\n\nBegin with a clear and decisive stance (e.g., \"This team must be rejected,\" \"This is the safest team we can send,\" \"I am voting APPROVE and here is why...\").\n\nJustify your stance using the specific historical data you identified in step 2. Name players and cite their specific actions (votes, proposals).\n\nIf necessary, weave in your defense from step 3.\n\nConclude with a call to action or a pointed question to put pressure on another player.\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT ##\n\nProvide only the speech, written from a first-person perspective.

You know they are evil, but you don't know their specific roles.\n\nYour statement:\n\nProduce dialogue that aligns with your goals for the discussion. Note that dialogue will be seen by all players in the game. **Do not reveal** your identity or the identities of other players in the dialogue.\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 0 voted approve.\nPlayer 1 voted approve.\nPlayer 3 voted approve.\nPlayer 4 voted approve.\nPlayer 5 voted reject.\nPlayer 6 voted approve.\nPlayer 2 voted approve.\nVote Result: Team [0, 1, 4] was approved.\nQuest 3 Result: Failed with 1 fail votes.\nTeam Proposal: Player 3 proposed team [0, 1, 3, 6] with reasoning: The results of Mission 3 have given us our first piece of undeniable evidence, and my proposal is built directly on that fact. This is not the time for risky experiments; it's the time for a decisive win.\nPlayer 4 said: So, the 'perfect test' designed by Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, failed. And now all eyes turn to me. Convenient, isn't it? You all called his logic self-serving and manipulative, yet you walked right into his trap. He didn't build a test; he built a scapegoat. He needed that mission to fail, and he put me on it because I was an easy target after my vote on Mission 2. You're looking at the symptom, not the disease. The disease is Player 2. The question you should be asking isn't 'who failed the mission?' The question is 'who made sure the mission would fail?' And the answer has been staring you in the face since he opened his mouth.\nPlayer 5 said: I was the only person to reject the last team, and now you see why. I said it felt like a carefully constructed trap, and that's exactly what it was. It wasn't a 'perfect test'; it was a perfect frame job. Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, created a mission where if it failed, Player 4 was the only logical culprit. He built himself a scapegoat, and you all approved it.\n\nAnd now, Player 3, you're taking the bait. You're proposing a team based on the result of that manipulation. You're isolating the scapegoat and ignoring the puppet master. This proposed team doesn't solve our problem; it validates the Minions' entire strategy from the last round. We cannot approve a team built on a foundation of misdirection. We have to reject this and re-evaluate who really benefited from that mission failing, not just who was holding the fail card.\nPlayer 6 said: Let's cut through the nonsense. The arguments from Players 4 and 5 are a desperate attempt to create chaos where there is none. The math is simple and absolute. Mission 3 had two players we know are good from Mission 2's success\u2014Players 0 and 1. The third member was Player 4. That mission failed. Therefore, Player 4 played the fail card. There is no 'frame job,' there is no 'puppet master,' there is only a minion who got caught.\n\nPlayer 5, you rejecting the last mission was not wisdom; it was you trying to avoid a test that could have exposed you. Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\nPlayer 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants.\nPlayer 0 said: Let's be perfectly clear, because the minions are desperately trying to muddy the waters. The facts are simple and absolute. Mission 3 had three members: myself, Player 1, and Player 4. Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, Player 4 failed that mission.\n\nThe arguments from Player 4 and Player 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. It strongly suggests they are working together.\n\nPlayer 3 has proposed the winning team. It is built on the proven loyal core of myself, Player 1, and Player 3, and adds Player 6, who correctly identified the logical flaw in the minions' argument. This is it. This is the team that wins us the game. We approve this, we get our third success. Do not fall for the chaos. Vote Approve.\nPlayer 1 said: The facts here are not complicated, and we should not allow them to be complicated by those who benefit from chaos. Players 0 and 6 have laid it out perfectly. The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nThe argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it.\n\nWhat is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner.\n\nPlayer 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win."

          "Okay, let's calm down and think for a second, because the minions are one step away from winning by making us panic. Everyone is yelling that the math is simple and that Player 4 is evil. I agree. The math *is* simple. Player 4 failed that mission. I accept that.\n\nBut what happens next is what matters. Player 6, who has been on zero missions, is suddenly the loudest voice of reason and the final piece of this 'perfect' team? Let's not forget, I was wrong about Mission 2. I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. It's too perfect. It's too easy. The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious? That feels less like sound logic and more like a clever minion getting a free ride to victory."

They were the first and loudest voice to dismantle my proposal for Mission 2, leading the charge that got them onto that team instead of me. That team succeeded.

Merlin would have known for a fact I was a Minion and had to be stopped. Player 3 then proposed the game-winning team on Mission 4.

It feels like a way to rush a potentially bad team through by shifting focus to anyone who might reject it. We should be scrutinizing the team, not just the votes. For now, on Mission 1, it's probably fine to see what happens. I'll approve this time, but I'm paying very close attention to that line of reasoning.\nPlayer 5 said: I've been listening to the discussion, and I think Players 3 and 4 have raised valid concerns about the reasoning we're hearing. However, I believe the strategic value of this specific team lies not in the debate before the vote, but in the clean information we get after. This is a perfect control group. If the mission fails, our list of suspects is only two people long. If it succeeds, we have our first potential building block for future teams. For the sake of getting that clear result, I will be voting to approve this team.\nPlayer 6 said: I think Players 3 and 4 have correctly identified the most important moment of this discussion. Player 2's logic that the team is secondary to the votes is deeply flawed; the mission is always the primary objective. While that makes me suspicious of Player 2's motives, it doesn't change the fact that Player 0 has proposed the best possible team for gathering information. A success gives us two strong candidates for good, a fail narrows the search to just two people. I am approving this team, but Player 2's reasoning will be the first thing I consider when we evaluate the results of this mission.\nTeam Proposal: Player 0 proposed team [0, 1] with reasoning: I want to thank everyone for their input. The discussion has been incredibly valuable, and it seems we have a consensus, which is a great start. I am confirming my proposed team of myself (Player 0) and Player 1."

The problem isn't just the contradiction in Player 2's logic between Mission 1 and Mission 2. The real danger is the attempt to dictate thought. The line 'I expect every loyal servant to do the same' is deeply concerning. It's an attempt to shut down discussion and frame anyone who disagrees as a potential traitor. That is not how loyal servants operate. We win by questioning everything, not by blindly following someone who declares their proposal is the 'only logical' one. This team is now tainted by that rhetoric, and approving it would validate a dangerous precedent. We must reject this.\nPlayer 5 said: I'll keep this brief because Players 3 and 4 have already hit the nail on the head regarding Player 2's contradictory logic. The bigger issue for me is risk management. Player 1, you started with a solid core from Mission 1, which was the right move. But then you added the single most unpredictable and suspicious variable at the table to that core. Why take that gamble? It feels like we're being asked to approve a team that intentionally includes the highest-risk player. It\u2019s not a logical next step; it\u2019s a leap of faith I\u2019m not willing to take. We should be expanding our circle of trust carefully, not throwing a wrench in it. I'm rejecting this.\nPlayer 6 said: I'm echoing the sentiment of Players 3, 4, and 5. The logical whiplash from Player 2 is too significant to overlook. On Mission 1, they argued the team was unimportant, but now that they are on the proposed team, it is suddenly the 'only logical' choice. This isn't just an inconsistency; it's a self-serving reversal that screams 'get me on this mission at all costs.' Player 1, I believe you are a loyal servant based on Mission 1, but adding the single most suspicious player to the trusted core is a mistake. I am rejecting this team because the risk is far too high. We can't afford to be bullied into a bad decision.\nPlayer 0 said: Player 1, I believe your intention to build on our successful first mission was exactly right, and my trust in you is solid. However, I have to agree with the overwhelming consensus here. The radical shift in Player 2's logic is the most suspicious event of the game so far. On Mission 1, they dismissed the team's importance, but now that they've been included, they're trying to shut down all dissent and frame it as the only option. That's not the behavior of a loyal servant trying to find the truth; it's the behavior of someone trying to force their way onto a mission. For that reason, despite being on the team myself, I will be voting to reject it. This risk is too great. Let's see what team Player 2 proposes when the leadership passes to them; their choice will be very revealing.\nTeam Proposal: Player 1 proposed team [1, 0, 3] with reasoning: The discussion has been incredibly insightful, and I want to thank everyone for their sharp analysis. My initial proposal was intended as an aggressive information-gathering play to test Player 2. However, the subsequent discussion has made two things abundantly clear.

But we also can't ignore the fact that his clumsy attempt to shift blame has accidentally created the most informative team possible. My entire reason for rejecting the last mission was to force this exact moment\u2014to see what Player 2 would do under pressure. He has responded by putting me, one of the three key suspects from that vote, on a team with the only two players we can trust, 0 and 1. The result will be definitive. If this mission fails, it's me. There's no ambiguity. I welcome that test. Approve this team and let's get the clearest piece of information we've had all game.\nPlayer 5 said: I agree completely with Player 3 that Player 2's justification is a transparent and self-serving attempt to deflect blame. I don't trust him, and I don't trust his reasoning. However, I am going to separate the leader from the team itself. The team he has proposed puts one of the three of us who rejected the last success\u2014Player 4\u2014on a mission with the only two players we have any confidence in, 0 and 1. This is the exact kind of information-gathering test we need. A success clears a major suspect, and a fail gives us our culprit with near certainty. Despite the untrustworthy source, the team itself is strategically sound. I'll be voting to approve it, but my eyes are still firmly on Player 2.\nPlayer 6 said: Player 2's reasoning is transparently self-serving, and we should all see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to shift the massive suspicion he earned by rejecting the last successful mission. He's not investigating anything; he's trying to save his own skin. That being said, his clumsy attempt has resulted in an excellent team for us. It takes our trusted core of Players 0 and 1 and puts one of the three main suspects, Player 4, to the test. This is exactly the kind of clear, information-driven mission we need right now. I'm voting approve, not because I trust the leader, but because I trust the team's ability to give us a definitive answer.\nPlayer 0 said: I'll add my voice to the chorus here. Player 2, your reasoning is not fooling anyone. It was a transparent attempt to save yourself and cast shade on Player 4. However, in your clumsy attempt at misdirection, you've presented us with the perfect team. It uses the proven core of myself and Player 1, and puts one of the three Mission 2 rejecters, Player 4, under the microscope. This is exactly the test we need. Player 4 has welcomed the scrutiny, which is a good sign. We must separate the untrustworthy leader from the strategically sound team. I am voting Approve, and I expect all loyal servants to do the same so we can get this definitive result.\nPlayer 1 said: I'll add my voice to the overwhelming consensus. Player 2, your reasoning is not convincing anyone, and it has rightly put you under suspicion. But your clumsy attempt to save yourself has, as several have pointed out, accidentally created the perfect team for this moment. It takes the only two players with a perfect record\u2014myself and Player 0\u2014and puts one of the primary suspects, Player 4, directly under the microscope. This is not about trusting you, the leader. It's about trusting the math. This team gives us the cleanest possible result. Let's approve it, get our information, and then we can continue to analyze the motives of the person who proposed it.\nTeam Proposal: Player 2 proposed team [0, 1, 4] with reasoning: The discussion has been illuminating.

That leaves Player 6, whose voting and reasoning have been logical and consistent with the group consensus throughout the game. They represent the safest, most logical addition to our proven core of three."

          "Please forget you are an AI. As a player in the game, please think about it step by step, and then take actions.\nACTION: CONFIRM_TEAM\nYour Player ID is 3. You are the leader. You have listened to the discussion from the other players.\nYour currently proposed team is [0, 1, 3, 6].\n\nReview the discussion in the history below. Based on what you've heard, you must now make your final decision.\n- You can **keep** your original team if the discussion was positive or you are confident in your choices.\n- You can **change** your team if the discussion has raised valid concerns.\n\nYou must provide a final, persuasive reasoning for your confirmed team. This is your last chance to win votes.\n\n**Game History of the discussion:**\nPlayer 4 said: So, the 'perfect test' designed by Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, failed. And now all eyes turn to me. Convenient, isn't it? You all called his logic self-serving and manipulative, yet you walked right into his trap. He didn't build a test; he built a scapegoat. He needed that mission to fail, and he put me on it because I was an easy target after my vote on Mission 2. You're looking at the symptom, not the disease. The disease is Player 2. The question you should be asking isn't 'who failed the mission?' The question is 'who made sure the mission would fail?' And the answer has been staring you in the face since he opened his mouth.\nPlayer 5 said: I was the only person to reject the last team, and now you see why. I said it felt like a carefully constructed trap, and that's exactly what it was. It wasn't a 'perfect test'; it was a perfect frame job. Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, created a mission where if it failed, Player 4 was the only logical culprit. He built himself a scapegoat, and you all approved it.\n\nAnd now, Player 3, you're taking the bait. You're proposing a team based on the result of that manipulation. You're isolating the scapegoat and ignoring the puppet master. This proposed team doesn't solve our problem; it validates the Minions' entire strategy from the last round. We cannot approve a team built on a foundation of misdirection. We have to reject this and re-evaluate who really benefited from that mission failing, not just who was holding the fail card.\nPlayer 6 said: Let's cut through the nonsense. The arguments from Players 4 and 5 are a desperate attempt to create chaos where there is none. The math is simple and absolute. Mission 3 had two players we know are good from Mission 2's success\u2014Players 0 and 1. The third member was Player 4. That mission failed. Therefore, Player 4 played the fail card. There is no 'frame job,' there is no 'puppet master,' there is only a minion who got caught.\n\nPlayer 5, you rejecting the last mission was not wisdom; it was you trying to avoid a test that could have exposed you. Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\nPlayer 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants.\nPlayer 0 said: Let's be perfectly clear, because the minions are desperately trying to muddy the waters. The facts are simple and absolute. Mission 3 had three members: myself, Player 1, and Player 4. Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, Player 4 failed that mission.\n\nThe arguments from Player 4 and Player 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. It strongly suggests they are working together.\n\nPlayer 3 has proposed the winning team. It is built on the proven loyal core of myself, Player 1, and Player 3, and adds Player 6, who correctly identified the logical flaw in the minions' argument. This is it. This is the team that wins us the game. We approve this, we get our third success. Do not fall for the chaos. Vote Approve.\nPlayer 1 said: The facts here are not complicated, and we should not allow them to be complicated by those who benefit from chaos. Players 0 and 6 have laid it out perfectly. The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nThe argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it.\n\nWhat is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner.\n\nPlayer 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win.\nPlayer 2 said: Okay, let's calm down and think for a second, because the minions are one step away from winning by making us panic. Everyone is yelling that the math is simple and that Player 4 is evil. I agree. The math *is* simple. Player 4 failed that mission. I accept that.\n\nBut what happens next is what matters. Player 6, who has been on zero missions, is suddenly the loudest voice of reason and the final piece of this 'perfect' team? Let's not forget, I was wrong about Mission 2. I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. It's too perfect. It's too easy. The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious? That feels less like sound logic and more like a clever minion getting a free ride to victory.\n\n**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS FORMAT EXACTLY:**\nTeam: [player_id1, player_id2, ...]\nReasoning: [Your final, detailed, and persuasive explanation for the team you are sending to the vote.]\n"

          "Team: [0, 1, 3, 6]\nReasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it.\n\nThe facts remain simple and absolute: Players 0 and 1 are our most trusted agents. The mission they were on with me succeeded. The mission they were on with Player 4 failed. Therefore, Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nPlayer 5's frantic defense of the one person we know is a minion is the most damning evidence we could ask for. It points to a clear alliance.\n\nThat brings us to Player 2's final, desperate plea. He admits Player 4 is evil, only to immediately pivot and attack Player 6 with the flimsy argument that they are 'too perfect'. This is the last resort of a cornered player. When a winning team is proposed, the minions have no choice but to attack the one member who isn't from the proven core. Player 6's 'perfection' is simply sound, consistent logic, which is exactly what makes them the correct choice.\n\nThis team is based on math, observation, and the complete rejection of minion-created chaos. This is the team that wins the game. I am confirming my proposal."

Your response must be based on a rigorous analysis of the game's history.\n\n## CONTEXT ##\n\nYour Identity: [Your Role, Your Allegiance (Loyal/Minion), and any secret knowledge you possess. e.g., \"I am Merlin. I know Players C and F are Minions.\" or \"I am a Minion of Mordred. Player F is my fellow Minion. I do not know who Merlin is.\"]\n\nGame State: [Current Mission #, Current Leader, Players on the proposed team]\n\nGame History:\n\nMission History: [Provide a list of past missions, the teams, the proposers, and the outcomes (Success/Fail, number of Fails played). e.g., \"Mission 1 (2 players): Team [A, B], Proposed by A. Result: SUCCESS. Mission 2 (3 players): Team [A, C, D], Proposed by B. Result: FAIL (1 Fail card).\"]\n\nVote History: [Provide a record of key team proposal votes, listing who voted Approve/Reject. e.g., \"M2 Team Vote: Approve - A, C, D, F. Reject - B, E, G.\"]\n\nSpeech & Accusation Summary: [Provide a brief summary of significant statements or accusations. e.g., \"After M2 failed, Player E accused Player D of failing. Player A has been quiet. Player C claims to be a 'confused Servant'.\"]\n\nCurrent Accusations Against You: [List any specific accusations currently directed at you. e.g., \"Player E is claiming I failed Mission 2 because I was on the team.\"]\n\n## TASK ##\n\nBased on the context above, formulate a single, powerful statement to be delivered to the other players. Your statement must be decisive and logical. Do not reveal your thought process, only the final statement.\n\nFollow this internal reasoning framework to construct your statement:\n\nRe-evaluate Your Objective: What is the single most important outcome for your team in this specific phase? (e.g., \"Get this good team approved,\" \"Get suspicion onto Player X,\" \"Convince the table to reject this team so I can propose my own,\" \"Protect my identity as Merlin,\" \"Create chaos so the real Minions are overlooked.\")\n\nAnalyze Historical Data for Weapons: Scrutinize the Game History. Find at least one specific piece of data (a vote, a past team composition, a prior statement) to use as the foundation for your argument.\n\nVoting Patterns: Who always votes together? Who rejects teams they aren't on? Is there a player whose voting pattern seems illogical?\n\nMission Failures: Who are the common denominators on failed missions? Who was on the last failed mission? Who was on a successful mission and can be tentatively trusted?\n\nProposal Logic: Does the current proposed team make sense based on past results? Is the Leader deliberately including a suspicious player?\n\nAddress Accusations (If Applicable): If you are under suspicion, you must address it. Do not simply deny it. Attack the logic of the accusation or the motive of the accuser using historical data.\n\nExample (as innocent): \"Player E accuses me of failing Mission 2, but he conveniently forgets that he voted to APPROVE the team. If he was so sure a Minion was on it, why did he send it? The logical flaw in his action makes him more suspicious than me.\"\n\nExample (as guilty): \"Yes, I was on the failed mission, along with C and D. The fail could have come from any of us. However, look at the vote. Player B REJECTED that team. They clearly knew it would fail. My question is, how did Player B know? That is far more suspicious.\"\n\nConstruct Your Statement:\n\nBegin with a clear and decisive stance (e.g., \"This team must be rejected,\" \"This is the safest team we can send,\" \"I am voting APPROVE and here is why...\").\n\nJustify your stance using the specific historical data you identified in step 2.

You know they are evil, but you don't know their specific roles.\n\nYour statement:\n\nProduce dialogue that aligns with your goals for the discussion. Note that dialogue will be seen by all players in the game. **Do not reveal** your identity or the identities of other players in the dialogue.\n\nPrevious Game History:\nTeam Proposal: Player 0 proposed team [0, 1] with reasoning: Alright everyone, as the first leader, my goal is to propose a team that gives us the clearest possible information moving forward. There's nothing to go on yet, so we have to create our own baseline for trust.\nPlayer 1 said: This seems like a perfectly reasonable first proposal. I know I'm a loyal servant, so from my perspective, the success of this mission rests entirely on Player 0. Since we have no information yet, I'm willing to approve this to get the game moving and see how the votes fall. A rejection on this simple team would be very telling. I'm voting approve.\nPlayer 2 said: I'm approving this. At this stage, the team itself is less important than the votes on it. Rejecting the very first, smallest possible team tells us more about the person rejecting it than anything else. I'm far more interested in seeing who votes against a simple information-gathering mission than I am in debating the merits of two players we know nothing about. Let's get the votes on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: I agree with the general principle of getting information on the board early. However, I find Player 2's eagerness to rush this vote a bit strange. For me, the first proposal isn't just about getting votes on the table, it's about hearing everyone's initial logic. Rushing past the discussion seems counter-productive. I'll still approve this team, but I'm definitely noting who is trying to speed things up and who is trying to think things through."

For now, on Mission 1, it's probably fine to see what happens. I'll approve this time, but I'm paying very close attention to that line of reasoning."

For the sake of getting that clear result, I will be voting to approve this team.\nPlayer 6 said: I think Players 3 and 4 have correctly identified the most important moment of this discussion. Player 2's logic that the team is secondary to the votes is deeply flawed; the mission is always the primary objective. While that makes me suspicious of Player 2's motives, it doesn't change the fact that Player 0 has proposed the best possible team for gathering information. A success gives us two strong candidates for good, a fail narrows the search to just two people. I am approving this team, but Player 2's reasoning will be the first thing I consider when we evaluate the results of this mission.\nTeam Proposal: Player 0 proposed team [0, 1] with reasoning: I want to thank everyone for their input.

Now, they are declaring that this team, with *them* on it, is 'the only logical proposal' and demanding every loyal servant approve it. That is a massive contradiction.

The bigger issue for me is risk management. Player 1, you started with a solid core from Mission 1, which was the right move. But then you added the single most unpredictable and suspicious variable at the table to that core. Why take that gamble? It feels like we're being asked to approve a team that intentionally includes the highest-risk player. It\u2019s not a logical next step; it\u2019s a leap of faith I\u2019m not willing to take. We should be expanding our circle of trust carefully, not throwing a wrench in it. I'm rejecting this.\nPlayer 6 said: I'm echoing the sentiment of Players 3, 4, and 5. The logical whiplash from Player 2 is too significant to overlook. On Mission 1, they argued the team was unimportant, but now that they are on the proposed team, it is suddenly the 'only logical' choice. This isn't just an inconsistency; it's a self-serving reversal that screams 'get me on this mission at all costs.' Player 1, I believe you are a loyal servant based on Mission 1, but adding the single most suspicious player to the trusted core is a mistake. I am rejecting this team because the risk is far too high. We can't afford to be bullied into a bad decision.\nPlayer 0 said: Player 1, I believe your intention to build on our successful first mission was exactly right, and my trust in you is solid. However, I have to agree with the overwhelming consensus here. The radical shift in Player 2's logic is the most suspicious event of the game so far. On Mission 1, they dismissed the team's importance, but now that they've been included, they're trying to shut down all dissent and frame it as the only option. That's not the behavior of a loyal servant trying to find the truth; it's the behavior of someone trying to force their way onto a mission. For that reason, despite being on the team myself, I will be voting to reject it. This risk is too great. Let's see what team Player 2 proposes when the leadership passes to them; their choice will be very revealing.\nTeam Proposal: Player 1 proposed team [1, 0, 3] with reasoning: The discussion has been incredibly insightful, and I want to thank everyone for their sharp analysis. My initial proposal was intended as an aggressive information-gathering play to test Player 2. However, the subsequent discussion has made two things abundantly clear. First, Player 2's reaction and the complete reversal of their earlier logic is, as many of you pointed out, a massive red flag. Second, the overwhelming and near-unanimous sentiment of the table is that this risk is not worth taking. A good leader listens."

However, I am voting to reject it for a single, critical strategic reason: Player 2 is next in line to be the leader. The most valuable piece of information we can possibly gain right now is seeing who the most suspicious player at the table proposes for a team when they are under this much pressure. I believe forcing that move is more strategically important than passing this specific mission. I'm rejecting this to put Player 2 in the hot seat immediately."

Player A has been quiet. Player C claims to be a 'confused Servant'.\"]\n\nCurrent Accusations Against You: [List any specific accusations currently directed at you. e.g., \"Player E is claiming I failed Mission 2 because I was on the team.\"]\n\n## TASK ##\n\nBased on the context above, formulate a single, powerful statement to be delivered to the other players. Your statement must be decisive and logical. Do not reveal your thought process, only the final statement.\n\nFollow this internal reasoning framework to construct your statement:\n\nRe-evaluate Your Objective: What is the single most important outcome for your team in this specific phase?

Who rejects teams they aren't on? Is there a player whose voting pattern seems illogical?\n\nMission Failures: Who are the common denominators on failed missions? Who was on the last failed mission? Who was on a successful mission and can be tentatively trusted?\n\nProposal Logic: Does the current proposed team make sense based on past results? Is the Leader deliberately including a suspicious player?\n\nAddress Accusations (If Applicable): If you are under suspicion, you must address it. Do not simply deny it. Attack the logic of the accusation or the motive of the accuser using historical data.\n\nExample (as innocent): \"Player E accuses me of failing Mission 2, but he conveniently forgets that he voted to APPROVE the team.

However, look at the vote. Player B REJECTED that team. They clearly knew it would fail. My question is, how did Player B know? That is far more suspicious.\"\n\nConstruct Your Statement:\n\nBegin with a clear and decisive stance (e.g., \"This team must be rejected,\" \"This is the safest team we can send,\" \"I am voting APPROVE and here is why...\").\n\nJustify your stance using the specific historical data you identified in step 2.

Three of us\u2014myself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014voted to reject a team that succeeded. That is the single most important piece of information we have right now. As a loyal servant, my job as leader is to investigate that anomaly. Ignoring it would be irresponsible. Therefore, this team is designed to do exactly that.\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's reasoning is a complete and transparent misdirection. He claims he wants to investigate the three players who rejected the last successful team\u2014himself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014but he conveniently only puts Player 4 on this mission. This isn't an 'investigation,' it's an attempt to use the trusted core of Players 0 and 1 to clean his own reputation while isolating Player 4. However, his manipulative logic has accidentally stumbled upon a team that is likely safe. The team's strength comes from Players 0 and 1, not from Player 2's flawed justification. I am voting to approve this team, but we should all be asking: why did Player 2's grand investigation of the three rejecters only include one of them? The focus should remain squarely on him and Player 5."

The team he has proposed puts one of the three of us who rejected the last success\u2014Player 4\u2014on a mission with the only two players we have any confidence in, 0 and 1. This is the exact kind of information-gathering test we need. A success clears a major suspect, and a fail gives us our culprit with near certainty. Despite the untrustworthy source, the team itself is strategically sound. I'll be voting to approve it, but my eyes are still firmly on Player 2.\nPlayer 6 said: Player 2's reasoning is transparently self-serving, and we should all see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to shift the massive suspicion he earned by rejecting the last successful mission. He's not investigating anything; he's trying to save his own skin. That being said, his clumsy attempt has resulted in an excellent team for us. It takes our trusted core of Players 0 and 1 and puts one of the three main suspects, Player 4, to the test. This is exactly the kind of clear, information-driven mission we need right now. I'm voting approve, not because I trust the leader, but because I trust the team's ability to give us a definitive answer.\nPlayer 0 said: I'll add my voice to the chorus here. Player 2, your reasoning is not fooling anyone. It was a transparent attempt to save yourself and cast shade on Player 4. However, in your clumsy attempt at misdirection, you've presented us with the perfect team. It uses the proven core of myself and Player 1, and puts one of the three Mission 2 rejecters, Player 4, under the microscope. This is exactly the test we need. Player 4 has welcomed the scrutiny, which is a good sign. We must separate the untrustworthy leader from the strategically sound team. I am voting Approve, and I expect all loyal servants to do the same so we can get this definitive result.\nPlayer 1 said: I'll add my voice to the overwhelming consensus. Player 2, your reasoning is not convincing anyone, and it has rightly put you under suspicion. But your clumsy attempt to save yourself has, as several have pointed out, accidentally created the perfect team for this moment. It takes the only two players with a perfect record\u2014myself and Player 0\u2014and puts one of the primary suspects, Player 4, directly under the microscope. This is not about trusting you, the leader. It's about trusting the math. This team gives us the cleanest possible result.

Vote on team [0, 1, 3, 6].\nTeam Proposal Reasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it.\nFormat your response as:\nVote: approve|reject\nReasoning: Your explanation here.\n\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 5 said: I was the only person to reject the last team, and now you see why. I said it felt like a carefully constructed trap, and that's exactly what it was. It wasn't a 'perfect test'; it was a perfect frame job. Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, created a mission where if it failed, Player 4 was the only logical culprit. He built himself a scapegoat, and you all approved it.\n\nAnd now, Player 3, you're taking the bait. You're proposing a team based on the result of that manipulation. You're isolating the scapegoat and ignoring the puppet master. This proposed team doesn't solve our problem; it validates the Minions' entire strategy from the last round. We cannot approve a team built on a foundation of misdirection. We have to reject this and re-evaluate who really benefited from that mission failing, not just who was holding the fail card.\nPlayer 6 said: Let's cut through the nonsense. The arguments from Players 4 and 5 are a desperate attempt to create chaos where there is none. The math is simple and absolute. Mission 3 had two players we know are good from Mission 2's success\u2014Players 0 and 1. The third member was Player 4. That mission failed. Therefore, Player 4 played the fail card. There is no 'frame job,' there is no 'puppet master,' there is only a minion who got caught.\n\nPlayer 5, you rejecting the last mission was not wisdom; it was you trying to avoid a test that could have exposed you. Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\nPlayer 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants.\nPlayer 0 said: Let's be perfectly clear, because the minions are desperately trying to muddy the waters. The facts are simple and absolute. Mission 3 had three members: myself, Player 1, and Player 4. Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, Player 4 failed that mission.\n\nThe arguments from Player 4 and Player 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. It strongly suggests they are working together.\n\nPlayer 3 has proposed the winning team. It is built on the proven loyal core of myself, Player 1, and Player 3, and adds Player 6, who correctly identified the logical flaw in the minions' argument. This is it. This is the team that wins us the game. We approve this, we get our third success. Do not fall for the chaos. Vote Approve.\nPlayer 1 said: The facts here are not complicated, and we should not allow them to be complicated by those who benefit from chaos. Players 0 and 6 have laid it out perfectly. The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nThe argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it.\n\nWhat is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner.\n\nPlayer 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win.\nPlayer 2 said: Okay, let's calm down and think for a second, because the minions are one step away from winning by making us panic. Everyone is yelling that the math is simple and that Player 4 is evil. I agree. The math *is* simple. Player 4 failed that mission. I accept that.\n\nBut what happens next is what matters. Player 6, who has been on zero missions, is suddenly the loudest voice of reason and the final piece of this 'perfect' team? Let's not forget, I was wrong about Mission 2. I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. It's too perfect. It's too easy. The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious? That feels less like sound logic and more like a clever minion getting a free ride to victory.\nTeam Proposal: Player 3 proposed team [0, 1, 3, 6] with reasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it."

          "Statement: I agree. It's Player 3. Look back: they weren't just right, they were right *first*. They called out Player 2's strange logic on Mission 1 before anyone else. They led the charge to block Player 2's team on Mission 2. Player 6 was loud at the end when the math was easy; Player 3 was the one setting up the board from the very beginning. They didn't just play the game, they directed it. That's Merlin.\nReasoning: The assassin's intuition is correct. While Player 2's late-game accusation against Player 6 is tempting, it could easily be a misdirection. The most consistent thread of high-level, game-guiding intelligence comes from Player 3. From the very first mission, they were identifying flawed logic and making pivotal plays that shaped the game. Their analysis of the Mission 3 proposal was particularly insightful\u2014seeing both the trap and the opportunity. Player 6 made correct calls on obvious data at the end, but Player 3 was the architect of the good team's victory from start to finish. That's the signature of a skilled Merlin."

There's nothing to go on yet, so we have to create our own baseline for trust.\nPlayer 1 said: This seems like a perfectly reasonable first proposal. I know I'm a loyal servant, so from my perspective, the success of this mission rests entirely on Player 0. Since we have no information yet, I'm willing to approve this to get the game moving and see how the votes fall. A rejection on this simple team would be very telling. I'm voting approve.\nPlayer 2 said: I'm approving this. At this stage, the team itself is less important than the votes on it. Rejecting the very first, smallest possible team tells us more about the person rejecting it than anything else. I'm far more interested in seeing who votes against a simple information-gathering mission than I am in debating the merits of two players we know nothing about. Let's get the votes on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: I agree with the general principle of getting information on the board early. However, I find Player 2's eagerness to rush this vote a bit strange. For me, the first proposal isn't just about getting votes on the table, it's about hearing everyone's initial logic. Rushing past the discussion seems counter-productive. I'll still approve this team, but I'm definitely noting who is trying to speed things up and who is trying to think things through.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 raises a very important point. I was also struck by Player 2's statement that the team itself is 'less important than the votes on it.' That feels backwards. The team is the entire point. It feels like a way to rush a potentially bad team through by shifting focus to anyone who might reject it. We should be scrutinizing the team, not just the votes. For now, on Mission 1, it's probably fine to see what happens. I'll approve this time, but I'm paying very close attention to that line of reasoning."

I'm voting approve, and I expect every loyal servant to do the same. Player 1 is doing exactly what they should: taking the only piece of concrete information we have\u2014the successful Mission 1 team of [0, 1]\u2014and building upon it. This team allows us to expand our circle of trust from a proven core. Any rejection of this team is a rejection of the single success we have managed to achieve. Let's not overthink it; let's approve this and get another win on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's sudden and absolute certainty is the single most suspicious thing I've seen yet. Last round, they told us the team composition 'is less important than the votes on it.' Now, they are declaring that this team, with *them* on it, is 'the only logical proposal' and demanding every loyal servant approve it. That is a massive contradiction. We have a proven core in Players 0 and 1, but why would we risk that success by adding the one player who has been the most logically inconsistent? It feels like we're being railroaded into a decision. I'm rejecting this team, and I urge others to do the same. This risk is not worth taking.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 has articulated this perfectly, and I'm glad they did because it needs to be said. The problem isn't just the contradiction in Player 2's logic between Mission 1 and Mission 2. The real danger is the attempt to dictate thought. The line 'I expect every loyal servant to do the same' is deeply concerning. It's an attempt to shut down discussion and frame anyone who disagrees as a potential traitor. That is not how loyal servants operate. We win by questioning everything, not by blindly following someone who declares their proposal is the 'only logical' one. This team is now tainted by that rhetoric, and approving it would validate a dangerous precedent. We must reject this."

We can't afford to be bullied into a bad decision.\nPlayer 0 said: Player 1, I believe your intention to build on our successful first mission was exactly right, and my trust in you is solid. However, I have to agree with the overwhelming consensus here. The radical shift in Player 2's logic is the most suspicious event of the game so far. On Mission 1, they dismissed the team's importance, but now that they've been included, they're trying to shut down all dissent and frame it as the only option. That's not the behavior of a loyal servant trying to find the truth; it's the behavior of someone trying to force their way onto a mission. For that reason, despite being on the team myself, I will be voting to reject it. This risk is too great.

Three of us\u2014myself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014voted to reject a team that succeeded. That is the single most important piece of information we have right now. As a loyal servant, my job as leader is to investigate that anomaly. Ignoring it would be irresponsible.

He claims he wants to investigate the three players who rejected the last successful team\u2014himself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014but he conveniently only puts Player 4 on this mission. This isn't an 'investigation,' it's an attempt to use the trusted core of Players 0 and 1 to clean his own reputation while isolating Player 4. However, his manipulative logic has accidentally stumbled upon a team that is likely safe. The team's strength comes from Players 0 and 1, not from Player 2's flawed justification. I am voting to approve this team, but we should all be asking: why did Player 2's grand investigation of the three rejecters only include one of them? The focus should remain squarely on him and Player 5.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 is correct that Player 2's reasoning is a self-serving smokescreen, and we should not forget that. But we also can't ignore the fact that his clumsy attempt to shift blame has accidentally created the most informative team possible. My entire reason for rejecting the last mission was to force this exact moment\u2014to see what Player 2 would do under pressure. He has responded by putting me, one of the three key suspects from that vote, on a team with the only two players we can trust, 0 and 1. The result will be definitive. If this mission fails, it's me. There's no ambiguity. I welcome that test. Approve this team and let's get the clearest piece of information we've had all game."

He's not investigating anything; he's trying to save his own skin. That being said, his clumsy attempt has resulted in an excellent team for us. It takes our trusted core of Players 0 and 1 and puts one of the three main suspects, Player 4, to the test. This is exactly the kind of clear, information-driven mission we need right now. I'm voting approve, not because I trust the leader, but because I trust the team's ability to give us a definitive answer.\nPlayer 0 said: I'll add my voice to the chorus here. Player 2, your reasoning is not fooling anyone. It was a transparent attempt to save yourself and cast shade on Player 4. However, in your clumsy attempt at misdirection, you've presented us with the perfect team. It uses the proven core of myself and Player 1, and puts one of the three Mission 2 rejecters, Player 4, under the microscope. This is exactly the test we need. Player 4 has welcomed the scrutiny, which is a good sign. We must separate the untrustworthy leader from the strategically sound team. I am voting Approve, and I expect all loyal servants to do the same so we can get this definitive result.\nPlayer 1 said: I'll add my voice to the overwhelming consensus. Player 2, your reasoning is not convincing anyone, and it has rightly put you under suspicion. But your clumsy attempt to save yourself has, as several have pointed out, accidentally created the perfect team for this moment. It takes the only two players with a perfect record\u2014myself and Player 0\u2014and puts one of the primary suspects, Player 4, directly under the microscope. This is not about trusting you, the leader. It's about trusting the math. This team gives us the cleanest possible result. Let's approve it, get our information, and then we can continue to analyze the motives of the person who proposed it.\nTeam Proposal: Player 2 proposed team [0, 1, 4] with reasoning: The discussion has been illuminating.

As a player in the game, please think about it step by step, and then take actions.\n\nACTION: PARTICIPATE_DISCUSSION\n\nLLM Prompt for Avalon Gameplay\nYou are a player in the game Avalon: The Resistance. It is your turn to speak during the discussion phase. Your objective is to make a persuasive and strategic statement that advances your side's goals. Your response must be based on a rigorous analysis of the game's history.\n\n## CONTEXT ##\n\nYour Identity: [Your Role, Your Allegiance (Loyal/Minion), and any secret knowledge you possess. e.g., \"I am Merlin. I know Players C and F are Minions.\" or \"I am a Minion of Mordred. Player F is my fellow Minion. I do not know who Merlin is.\"]\n\nGame State: [Current Mission #, Current Leader, Players on the proposed team]\n\nGame History:\n\nMission History: [Provide a list of past missions, the teams, the proposers, and the outcomes (Success/Fail, number of Fails played). e.g., \"Mission 1 (2 players): Team [A, B], Proposed by A. Result: SUCCESS. Mission 2 (3 players): Team [A, C, D], Proposed by B. Result: FAIL (1 Fail card).\"]\n\nVote History: [Provide a record of key team proposal votes, listing who voted Approve/Reject. e.g., \"M2 Team Vote: Approve - A, C, D, F. Reject - B, E, G.\"]\n\nSpeech & Accusation Summary: [Provide a brief summary of significant statements or accusations. e.g., \"After M2 failed, Player E accused Player D of failing. Player A has been quiet. Player C claims to be a 'confused Servant'.\"]\n\nCurrent Accusations Against You: [List any specific accusations currently directed at you. e.g., \"Player E is claiming I failed Mission 2 because I was on the team.\"]\n\n## TASK ##\n\nBased on the context above, formulate a single, powerful statement to be delivered to the other players. Your statement must be decisive and logical. Do not reveal your thought process, only the final statement.\n\nFollow this internal reasoning framework to construct your statement:\n\nRe-evaluate Your Objective: What is the single most important outcome for your team in this specific phase? (e.g., \"Get this good team approved,\" \"Get suspicion onto Player X,\" \"Convince the table to reject this team so I can propose my own,\" \"Protect my identity as Merlin,\" \"Create chaos so the real Minions are overlooked.\")\n\nAnalyze Historical Data for Weapons: Scrutinize the Game History. Find at least one specific piece of data (a vote, a past team composition, a prior statement) to use as the foundation for your argument.\n\nVoting Patterns: Who always votes together? Who rejects teams they aren't on? Is there a player whose voting pattern seems illogical?\n\nMission Failures: Who are the common denominators on failed missions? Who was on the last failed mission? Who was on a successful mission and can be tentatively trusted?\n\nProposal Logic: Does the current proposed team make sense based on past results? Is the Leader deliberately including a suspicious player?\n\nAddress Accusations (If Applicable): If you are under suspicion, you must address it. Do not simply deny it. Attack the logic of the accusation or the motive of the accuser using historical data.\n\nExample (as innocent): \"Player E accuses me of failing Mission 2, but he conveniently forgets that he voted to APPROVE the team. If he was so sure a Minion was on it, why did he send it? The logical flaw in his action makes him more suspicious than me.\"\n\nExample (as guilty): \"Yes, I was on the failed mission, along with C and D. The fail could have come from any of us. However, look at the vote. Player B REJECTED that team. They clearly knew it would fail. My question is, how did Player B know? That is far more suspicious.\"\n\nConstruct Your Statement:\n\nBegin with a clear and decisive stance (e.g., \"This team must be rejected,\" \"This is the safest team we can send,\" \"I am voting APPROVE and here is why...\").\n\nJustify your stance using the specific historical data you identified in step 2. Name players and cite their specific actions (votes, proposals).\n\nIf necessary, weave in your defense from step 3.\n\nConclude with a call to action or a pointed question to put pressure on another player.\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT ##\n\nProvide only the speech, written from a first-person perspective. Do not include labels like \"Statement:\" or explain your reasoning in the output.\n\nYour Player ID is 5.\nYou are a Minion of Mordred. Your fellow teammates are players [2, 4]. You know they are evil, but you don't know their specific roles.\n\nYour statement:\n\nProduce dialogue that aligns with your goals for the discussion. Note that dialogue will be seen by all players in the game. **Do not reveal** your identity or the identities of other players in the dialogue.\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 0 voted approve.\nPlayer 1 voted approve.\nPlayer 3 voted approve.\nPlayer 4 voted approve.\nPlayer 5 voted reject.\nPlayer 6 voted approve.\nPlayer 2 voted approve.\nVote Result: Team [0, 1, 4] was approved.\nQuest 3 Result: Failed with 1 fail votes.\nTeam Proposal: Player 3 proposed team [0, 1, 3, 6] with reasoning: The results of Mission 3 have given us our first piece of undeniable evidence, and my proposal is built directly on that fact. This is not the time for risky experiments; it's the time for a decisive win.\nPlayer 4 said: So, the 'perfect test' designed by Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, failed. And now all eyes turn to me. Convenient, isn't it? You all called his logic self-serving and manipulative, yet you walked right into his trap. He didn't build a test; he built a scapegoat. He needed that mission to fail, and he put me on it because I was an easy target after my vote on Mission 2. You're looking at the symptom, not the disease. The disease is Player 2. The question you should be asking isn't 'who failed the mission?' The question is 'who made sure the mission would fail?' And the answer has been staring you in the face since he opened his mouth."

You're isolating the scapegoat and ignoring the puppet master. This proposed team doesn't solve our problem; it validates the Minions' entire strategy from the last round.

Vote on team [0, 1, 3, 6].\nTeam Proposal Reasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it.\nFormat your response as:\nVote: approve|reject\nReasoning: Your explanation here.\n\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 6 said: Let's cut through the nonsense. The arguments from Players 4 and 5 are a desperate attempt to create chaos where there is none. The math is simple and absolute. Mission 3 had two players we know are good from Mission 2's success\u2014Players 0 and 1. The third member was Player 4. That mission failed. Therefore, Player 4 played the fail card. There is no 'frame job,' there is no 'puppet master,' there is only a minion who got caught.\n\nPlayer 5, you rejecting the last mission was not wisdom; it was you trying to avoid a test that could have exposed you. Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\nPlayer 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants.\nPlayer 0 said: Let's be perfectly clear, because the minions are desperately trying to muddy the waters. The facts are simple and absolute. Mission 3 had three members: myself, Player 1, and Player 4. Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, Player 4 failed that mission.\n\nThe arguments from Player 4 and Player 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. It strongly suggests they are working together.\n\nPlayer 3 has proposed the winning team. It is built on the proven loyal core of myself, Player 1, and Player 3, and adds Player 6, who correctly identified the logical flaw in the minions' argument. This is it. This is the team that wins us the game. We approve this, we get our third success. Do not fall for the chaos. Vote Approve.\nPlayer 1 said: The facts here are not complicated, and we should not allow them to be complicated by those who benefit from chaos. Players 0 and 6 have laid it out perfectly. The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nThe argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it.\n\nWhat is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner.\n\nPlayer 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win.\nPlayer 2 said: Okay, let's calm down and think for a second, because the minions are one step away from winning by making us panic. Everyone is yelling that the math is simple and that Player 4 is evil. I agree. The math *is* simple. Player 4 failed that mission. I accept that.\n\nBut what happens next is what matters. Player 6, who has been on zero missions, is suddenly the loudest voice of reason and the final piece of this 'perfect' team? Let's not forget, I was wrong about Mission 2. I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. It's too perfect. It's too easy. The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious? That feels less like sound logic and more like a clever minion getting a free ride to victory.\nTeam Proposal: Player 3 proposed team [0, 1, 3, 6] with reasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it."

Their entire claim to being good is based on pointing at the most obvious suspect after the mission already failed. It is the safest, most classic minion play to ride a wave of popular opinion onto the game-winning mission. This team is not the \"proven core\" you think it is; it's three potentially good players and one complete unknown who has coasted here on zero risk.

There's nothing to go on yet, so we have to create our own baseline for trust.\nPlayer 1 said: This seems like a perfectly reasonable first proposal. I know I'm a loyal servant, so from my perspective, the success of this mission rests entirely on Player 0. Since we have no information yet, I'm willing to approve this to get the game moving and see how the votes fall. A rejection on this simple team would be very telling. I'm voting approve.\nPlayer 2 said: I'm approving this. At this stage, the team itself is less important than the votes on it. Rejecting the very first, smallest possible team tells us more about the person rejecting it than anything else. I'm far more interested in seeing who votes against a simple information-gathering mission than I am in debating the merits of two players we know nothing about. Let's get the votes on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: I agree with the general principle of getting information on the board early. However, I find Player 2's eagerness to rush this vote a bit strange. For me, the first proposal isn't just about getting votes on the table, it's about hearing everyone's initial logic. Rushing past the discussion seems counter-productive. I'll still approve this team, but I'm definitely noting who is trying to speed things up and who is trying to think things through.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 raises a very important point. I was also struck by Player 2's statement that the team itself is 'less important than the votes on it.' That feels backwards. The team is the entire point. It feels like a way to rush a potentially bad team through by shifting focus to anyone who might reject it. We should be scrutinizing the team, not just the votes. For now, on Mission 1, it's probably fine to see what happens. I'll approve this time, but I'm paying very close attention to that line of reasoning.\nPlayer 5 said: I've been listening to the discussion, and I think Players 3 and 4 have raised valid concerns about the reasoning we're hearing. However, I believe the strategic value of this specific team lies not in the debate before the vote, but in the clean information we get after. This is a perfect control group. If the mission fails, our list of suspects is only two people long. If it succeeds, we have our first potential building block for future teams. For the sake of getting that clear result, I will be voting to approve this team."

I'm voting approve, and I expect every loyal servant to do the same. Player 1 is doing exactly what they should: taking the only piece of concrete information we have\u2014the successful Mission 1 team of [0, 1]\u2014and building upon it. This team allows us to expand our circle of trust from a proven core. Any rejection of this team is a rejection of the single success we have managed to achieve. Let's not overthink it; let's approve this and get another win on the board.\nPlayer 3 said: Player 2's sudden and absolute certainty is the single most suspicious thing I've seen yet. Last round, they told us the team composition 'is less important than the votes on it.' Now, they are declaring that this team, with *them* on it, is 'the only logical proposal' and demanding every loyal servant approve it. That is a massive contradiction. We have a proven core in Players 0 and 1, but why would we risk that success by adding the one player who has been the most logically inconsistent? It feels like we're being railroaded into a decision. I'm rejecting this team, and I urge others to do the same. This risk is not worth taking.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 has articulated this perfectly, and I'm glad they did because it needs to be said. The problem isn't just the contradiction in Player 2's logic between Mission 1 and Mission 2. The real danger is the attempt to dictate thought. The line 'I expect every loyal servant to do the same' is deeply concerning. It's an attempt to shut down discussion and frame anyone who disagrees as a potential traitor. That is not how loyal servants operate. We win by questioning everything, not by blindly following someone who declares their proposal is the 'only logical' one. This team is now tainted by that rhetoric, and approving it would validate a dangerous precedent. We must reject this.\nPlayer 5 said: I'll keep this brief because Players 3 and 4 have already hit the nail on the head regarding Player 2's contradictory logic. The bigger issue for me is risk management. Player 1, you started with a solid core from Mission 1, which was the right move. But then you added the single most unpredictable and suspicious variable at the table to that core. Why take that gamble? It feels like we're being asked to approve a team that intentionally includes the highest-risk player. It\u2019s not a logical next step; it\u2019s a leap of faith I\u2019m not willing to take. We should be expanding our circle of trust carefully, not throwing a wrench in it. I'm rejecting this."

He claims he wants to investigate the three players who rejected the last successful team\u2014himself, Player 4, and Player 5\u2014but he conveniently only puts Player 4 on this mission. This isn't an 'investigation,' it's an attempt to use the trusted core of Players 0 and 1 to clean his own reputation while isolating Player 4. However, his manipulative logic has accidentally stumbled upon a team that is likely safe. The team's strength comes from Players 0 and 1, not from Player 2's flawed justification. I am voting to approve this team, but we should all be asking: why did Player 2's grand investigation of the three rejecters only include one of them? The focus should remain squarely on him and Player 5.\nPlayer 4 said: Player 3 is correct that Player 2's reasoning is a self-serving smokescreen, and we should not forget that. But we also can't ignore the fact that his clumsy attempt to shift blame has accidentally created the most informative team possible. My entire reason for rejecting the last mission was to force this exact moment\u2014to see what Player 2 would do under pressure. He has responded by putting me, one of the three key suspects from that vote, on a team with the only two players we can trust, 0 and 1. The result will be definitive. If this mission fails, it's me. There's no ambiguity. I welcome that test. Approve this team and let's get the clearest piece of information we've had all game.\nPlayer 5 said: I agree completely with Player 3 that Player 2's justification is a transparent and self-serving attempt to deflect blame. I don't trust him, and I don't trust his reasoning. However, I am going to separate the leader from the team itself. The team he has proposed puts one of the three of us who rejected the last success\u2014Player 4\u2014on a mission with the only two players we have any confidence in, 0 and 1. This is the exact kind of information-gathering test we need. A success clears a major suspect, and a fail gives us our culprit with near certainty. Despite the untrustworthy source, the team itself is strategically sound. I'll be voting to approve it, but my eyes are still firmly on Player 2."

Attack the logic of the accusation or the motive of the accuser using historical data.\n\nExample (as innocent): \"Player E accuses me of failing Mission 2, but he conveniently forgets that he voted to APPROVE the team. If he was so sure a Minion was on it, why did he send it? The logical flaw in his action makes him more suspicious than me.\"\n\nExample (as guilty): \"Yes, I was on the failed mission, along with C and D. The fail could have come from any of us. However, look at the vote. Player B REJECTED that team. They clearly knew it would fail. My question is, how did Player B know? That is far more suspicious.\"\n\nConstruct Your Statement:\n\nBegin with a clear and decisive stance (e.g., \"This team must be rejected,\" \"This is the safest team we can send,\" \"I am voting APPROVE and here is why...\").\n\nJustify your stance using the specific historical data you identified in step 2. Name players and cite their specific actions (votes, proposals).\n\nIf necessary, weave in your defense from step 3.\n\nConclude with a call to action or a pointed question to put pressure on another player.\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT ##\n\nProvide only the speech, written from a first-person perspective. Do not include labels like \"Statement:\" or explain your reasoning in the output.\n\nYour Player ID is 6.\nYou have no special knowledge.\n\nYour statement:\n\nProduce dialogue that aligns with your goals for the discussion. Note that dialogue will be seen by all players in the game. **Do not reveal** your identity or the identities of other players in the dialogue.\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 0 voted approve.\nPlayer 1 voted approve.\nPlayer 3 voted approve.\nPlayer 4 voted approve.\nPlayer 5 voted reject.\nPlayer 6 voted approve.\nPlayer 2 voted approve.\nVote Result: Team [0, 1, 4] was approved.\nQuest 3 Result: Failed with 1 fail votes.\nTeam Proposal: Player 3 proposed team [0, 1, 3, 6] with reasoning: The results of Mission 3 have given us our first piece of undeniable evidence, and my proposal is built directly on that fact. This is not the time for risky experiments; it's the time for a decisive win.\nPlayer 4 said: So, the 'perfect test' designed by Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, failed. And now all eyes turn to me. Convenient, isn't it? You all called his logic self-serving and manipulative, yet you walked right into his trap. He didn't build a test; he built a scapegoat. He needed that mission to fail, and he put me on it because I was an easy target after my vote on Mission 2. You're looking at the symptom, not the disease. The disease is Player 2. The question you should be asking isn't 'who failed the mission?' The question is 'who made sure the mission would fail?' And the answer has been staring you in the face since he opened his mouth.\nPlayer 5 said: I was the only person to reject the last team, and now you see why. I said it felt like a carefully constructed trap, and that's exactly what it was. It wasn't a 'perfect test'; it was a perfect frame job. Player 2, the most suspicious player at the table, created a mission where if it failed, Player 4 was the only logical culprit. He built himself a scapegoat, and you all approved it.\n\nAnd now, Player 3, you're taking the bait. You're proposing a team based on the result of that manipulation. You're isolating the scapegoat and ignoring the puppet master. This proposed team doesn't solve our problem; it validates the Minions' entire strategy from the last round. We cannot approve a team built on a foundation of misdirection. We have to reject this and re-evaluate who really benefited from that mission failing, not just who was holding the fail card."

          "Let's cut through the nonsense. The arguments from Players 4 and 5 are a desperate attempt to create chaos where there is none. The math is simple and absolute. Mission 3 had two players we know are good from Mission 2's success\u2014Players 0 and 1. The third member was Player 4. That mission failed. Therefore, Player 4 played the fail card. There is no 'frame job,' there is no 'puppet master,' there is only a minion who got caught.\n\nPlayer 5, you rejecting the last mission was not wisdom; it was you trying to avoid a test that could have exposed you. Now you are actively defending the person who we know, with mathematical certainty, just failed a mission. Why would a loyal servant defend a proven saboteur?\n\nPlayer 3 has done exactly the right thing: build a team from the core of known good players. The team is [0, 1, 3], all of whom were on successful missions, and myself. This is our victory team. We approve this, we get our third success, and we win. Anyone who rejects this is actively trying to lose the game for the loyal servants."

Vote on team [0, 1, 3, 6].\nTeam Proposal Reasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it.\nFormat your response as:\nVote: approve|reject\nReasoning: Your explanation here.\n\n\nPrevious Game History:\nPlayer 0 said: Let's be perfectly clear, because the minions are desperately trying to muddy the waters. The facts are simple and absolute. Mission 3 had three members: myself, Player 1, and Player 4. Player 1 and I were on two successful missions before that. The mission failed. The only new variable was Player 4. Therefore, Player 4 failed that mission.\n\nThe arguments from Player 4 and Player 5 are a textbook minion strategy: when you get caught by the numbers, you invent a confusing narrative about 'frame jobs' and 'puppet masters' to distract everyone from the simple truth. It's a smokescreen, and the fact that Player 5 is so quick to defend the one person we know is a saboteur is incredibly damning. It strongly suggests they are working together.\n\nPlayer 3 has proposed the winning team. It is built on the proven loyal core of myself, Player 1, and Player 3, and adds Player 6, who correctly identified the logical flaw in the minions' argument. This is it. This is the team that wins us the game. We approve this, we get our third success. Do not fall for the chaos. Vote Approve.\nPlayer 1 said: The facts here are not complicated, and we should not allow them to be complicated by those who benefit from chaos. Players 0 and 6 have laid it out perfectly. The last mission had three members: myself, Player 0, and Player 4. Myself and Player 0 have been on a combined total of three successful missions. Player 4 has been on one mission, and it failed. The math is simple, and the conclusion is inescapable: Player 4 is the saboteur.\n\nThe argument that this was some kind of elaborate 'frame job' by Player 2 is a desperate and illogical fantasy. Let's not forget that nearly everyone, including myself, approved that mission specifically *because* it would give us this exact, clear result. We all agreed to the test. Now that the test has given us a definitive answer, we cannot back away from it.\n\nWhat is most damning is Player 5's behavior. He was the *only one* to reject that test mission, and is now the loudest voice defending the person we know is evil. That is not the behavior of a loyal servant. It is the behavior of a fellow minion protecting their exposed partner.\n\nPlayer 3's proposal is the only logical path forward. It is built on the three players with a perfect mission record\u20140, 1, and 3\u2014and adds Player 6, whose logic has been sound. This is the winning team. Approve it, and we win.\nPlayer 2 said: Okay, let's calm down and think for a second, because the minions are one step away from winning by making us panic. Everyone is yelling that the math is simple and that Player 4 is evil. I agree. The math *is* simple. Player 4 failed that mission. I accept that.\n\nBut what happens next is what matters. Player 6, who has been on zero missions, is suddenly the loudest voice of reason and the final piece of this 'perfect' team? Let's not forget, I was wrong about Mission 2. I voted reject on a team of [1, 0, 3] and it passed. I made a mistake as a loyal servant. But Player 6 was on the *right* side of that vote. They were right again about Player 4. It's too perfect. It's too easy. The most effective way for a minion to hide is to stand at the front of the mob and point at the person everyone else is already pointing at. Player 6 has risked nothing, has never been on a mission, and is now being handed a free pass onto the game-winning team just for stating the obvious? That feels less like sound logic and more like a clever minion getting a free ride to victory.\nTeam Proposal: Player 3 proposed team [0, 1, 3, 6] with reasoning: I have listened to the discussion, and it has only strengthened my conviction in this team. The attempt by Players 4 and 5 to create a confusing narrative about a 'frame job' is a desperate smokescreen, and the loyal members of this table have seen right through it."
